## chapters
### about this application
* This page is a part of my **daily work log**, which is a showcase of my 
    * work (Javascript, React-onboarding, passion for terminal/PowerShell, foundational CS, etc.)
    * minimalist style
    * commitment to publish daily
* The exact process of work-logging is being continuously described in [the first article written for this work log]({% post_url 2019-11-01-blog-from-vsc-via-github-pages %})

### why would you be a good fit: communication, engagement and technical aptitude
* I am
    * Motivated by challenging **analytical tasks** and tickets
    * **Great at communication** with customers and **prefer synchronous communication**, I prefer to call people and solve issues personally. This is essential for me, for the big picture see the great Cal Newport's [Was E-mail a Mistake? The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake)
    * I have a natural sense of urgency and ownership when it comes to solving customer issues
    * I am a natural when it comes to processing improvements and automation. I am a big fan of laziness-promoting tools, as wonderfully described by Cap Watking in [The Boring Designer](https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-boring-designer)
* My dream is to become a JS FullStack engineer, so we resonate **on technical level**

### why Raisely: your mission
* In short, because of what you do
* My dream is to work for a meaningful/fair employee, so we resonate **on ethical level**
* I do have a high appreciation for software engineering and the role of software in our lives, but I am also aware of the dark side and would like to give my talents to someone who utilizes this great craft for the reduction of suffering in the world
* As an illustration, we decided with my partner to start giving gifts in form of creative charity donations, illustrated for example by [Skutečný dárek - obchod společnosti Člověk v tísni](https://www.skutecnydarek.cz/) (hope you understand what's going on)

### task selection: as near to dev as possible
* I have made a table and mapped all of the tasks from [Customer Success Engineer - Tasks](https://gist.github.com/jamiemling/66ed83e1d0abc07290ca0c7a8dd81c31)
* As a rule, the nearer support engineering is to software engineering, the more I am excited about it
* Also, I do value [Knowledge Centered Support Methodology](https://www.thekcsacademy.net/kcs/) so writing documentation and creating screencaptures are essential pieces of work
* Finally, I do prefer to handle difficult / VIP customers

### great platform: the rise of static site generators
* I am very enthusiastic about static-site generators and the value it has brought to the web 
* In short, I believe that the creative insight of building a web not on request, but when it is changed is an elegant stroke of genius and it really is a boon for performance
* I have migrated to Jekyll from first Wordpress and then Google Sites. And I believe that SSGs will need to face the complexity question solved by classical CMSs.
* My posts are currently organized as a file directory of markdown files, this would be unsustainable if we were a team of 50 writers, I believe
* Of course, if a web application is essentially an interactive one, the SSG or other JAMStack alternative is not an option
    * ... but there is server-side rendering with Next.JS, combined with React and Node
    * I am actually taking the course [Building Server-side Rendered React Apps for Beginners on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-server-side-rendered-react-apps-beginners)
