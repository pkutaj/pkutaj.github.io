Currently, I am an bi-lingual (EN/GER) L2-support agent with .NET and ExtJS CRM application (Avolin’s Pivotal CRM). I am also creating front-ends on the side (WordPress- and Jekyll-based). I have 2+ years of experience in data analytics (SAP BW) and I have been deeply caring about the creation and optimization of UI/UX experience. In addition, I find high value in the automation of routine tasks by writing VBA, Powershell and Google Apps Scripts, if need be. I insist on continuous and elegant technical documentation of everything, inspired by the methodology of knowledge-centered-support and thrilled by the rise of static site generators and jamstack as a technical implementation of the KCS methodology.
