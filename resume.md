Currently, I am an L2-support support agent (.NET based Pivotal CRM) creating front-ends on the side. Experienced in data analytics (SAP BW), deeply caring about the creation and optimization of customer’s UI/UX experience.  In addition, I find high value in the automation of routine tasks by writing VBA, Powershell and Google Apps Scripts — so-called laziness promoting tools. I insist on continuous and elegant technical documentation of everything, inspired by the methodology of knowledge-centered-support.
