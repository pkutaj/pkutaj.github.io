## the case	
the question is, why is Arial Unicode MS no longer available in never Microsoft Products, as this is a go-to fonts for rendering documents in various languages (for example Japanese )

## findings

* the reason Arial Unicode is no longer available in the newer versions of Office / Windows seems to be explained in [Arial Unicode MS font missing - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-word/arial-unicode-ms-font-missing/3d389ec7-dfaa-4002-adfd-5b1491cea8a1/)

>​When Microsoft included Arial Unicode MS with earlier versions of Office, Microsoft paid a licensing fee to The Monotype Corporation, which isthe copyright holder for the font. Someone at Microsoft decided it was no longer worthwhile to continue paying that fee, so it was removed fromthe Office package. 


### Google Noto
* If you look further, the current free reliable alternative is [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)
* I have found this reference coming from an academic environment and therefore I consider it reasonably reliable: [A free Unicode Replacement font to MS Arial Unicode](https://library.osu.edu/site/it/a-free-unicode-replacement-font-to-ms-arial-unicode/).

### On Arial history and value
> The design was created to substitute for Helvetica: Arial (and many other clones of the period) are metrically identical to the PostScript version of Helvetica, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without IBM having to pay Linotype for a Helvetica license on its printers.

> Yes, I dislike Arial more than Comic Sans. Though it’s the undisputed king of the goofy fonts, Comic Sans is at least honest about what it is. But Arial is merely a bland, zero-calorie Helvetica substitute. For many, the two are indistinguishable. But for typographers, Arial contains none of the consistency and balance that makes Helvetica successful. For instance, the ends of the lowercase a, c, e, g, s, and t in Helvetica are exactly horizontal. In Arial, those ends are sloped arbitrarily. Reading Arial is like trying to have dinner on a tippy restaurant table.Still, the main issue is overuse. After 25 years as a system font, Arial has achieved a ubiquity that rivals times new roman. And like Times New Roman, Arial is permanently associated with the work of people who will never care about typography.
