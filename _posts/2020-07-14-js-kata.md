### 1. task
* Given is a string containing just the characters 
    * `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, 
* Aim: determine if the input string is valid if:
    * Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    * Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    * Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false

### 2. BS
* there's either an array or an object, i would rather do this with an object

SCNR# | ENTER      | E.G.   | EXIT  | E.G.    | DONE
------|------------|--------|-------|---------|-----
1     | simple ()  | `()`   | true  | `true`  | ✅
2     | simple (}  | `(}`   | false | `bar`   | ✅
3     | closed     | `}}`   | false | `bar`   | ✅
5     | mix closed | `())`  | false | `false` | ✅
6     | embed      | `{[]}` | true  | `true`  |

### 3. RD
1. get the index of the opening bracket
2. no index for no bracket → false
3. once you get an index → true for that loop
4. the next one of that kind has to be the closed one
    * how to achieve that → iteration
* the index of the open has to be smaller -
* is it this key ? true ? is it closed ?
