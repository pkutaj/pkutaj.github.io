## the case	of XML versions
the question is, what versions of XML are out there ? 

## toc
<!-- TOC -->

- [sources](#sources)

<!-- /TOC -->

## findings
* surprisingly perhaps only **1.0** and **1.1**
* there is no **2.0**
* the last **EDITION** of **1.0** is **NEWER** than the last **EDITION** of **1.1**
    * the fifth edition of XML 
    * 
* in DBs, it seems to be important to refer to the xml versions
* in the opening of a document you can declare 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?> 
```

* It is an optional indication of the version of XML, the character encoding, and the standalone document declaration. 
* It can only appear as the very top of an XML file, if anywhere, and may not be repeated
