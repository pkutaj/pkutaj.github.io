### 1. notes
* indicates where a request originates from
* doesn't include path information
* is similar to the Referer header, but, unlike that header, it doesn't disclose the whole path.
* **browsers** add the Origin request header to:
    - all cross origin requests
    - same-origin requests except for GET or HEAD requests 
    - i.e. they are added to same-origin POST, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests
