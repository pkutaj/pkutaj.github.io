### 1. dot sourcing operators

```
. $profile
```

### 2. invocation operator

```
& $profile
```

### 3. issues
* not tested too much - but it does not re-import modules, so if you (like me) depend on â€” this does not happen
* that means, only changes to procedures directly within $profile are affected
