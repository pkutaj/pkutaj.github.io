### 1. notes
* We program with constructs
    - We have programming languages
    - We use particular libraries
* Those things have certain characteristics in and of themselves.
* But we're in a _business of artifacts_
    - We don't ship source code
    - The user doesn't look at our source code and say, "Ah, that's so pleasant." 
    - The user runs our software, and they run it for a long period of time
* Over time, we keep glomming more stuff on our software
* All of that stuff:
    - the running of it
    - the performance of it
    - the ability to change
    - it all is an attributes of the artifact ‚Äî not the original construct
* But again, here we still focus so much on our experience of the use of the construct
    - Oh, look; I only had to type 16 characters
    - Wow! That's great
    - No semicolons ... or things like that
* This whole notion of sort of programmer convenience, again, we are infatuated with it: not to our benefit
