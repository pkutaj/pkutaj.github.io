### 1. Shell in the integrated terminal
* this **OS shell** that you can default to (pwsh, powershell, bash, ...)
* it has no special integration with the files being edited in the editor
* they show by their executable file name in the dropdown list in the integrated terminal's toolbar, e.g. `pwsh`

### 2. Powershell Integrated Console
* special shell that comes with **PowerShell extension**
* offers **integration** with the code being edited
* provides linting and debugging support

### 3. Select Default shell for integrated console
* Within Powershell Integrated Console you can choose what version of PowerShell you default to
    * Core 
    * Windows Powershell
* This config is not intuitive at all â€” my default profile takes ~5 seconds to load, not acceptable in for development there I need to restart sessions regularly when writing scripts

```
Use the following steps to choose the version:

* Open the Command Palette on Windows or Linux with Ctrl+Shift+P. On macOS, use Cmd+Shift+P.
* Search for Session.
* Click on PowerShell: Show Session Menu.
* Choose the version of PowerShell you want to use from the list, for example PowerShell Core.
```
