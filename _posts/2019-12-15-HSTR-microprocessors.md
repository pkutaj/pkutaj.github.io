## the case	
from integraded circuit of the early 50s into the first modern OS of the early 80s

## findings
- PDP is the first smaller machine, 4kB of RAM
- 60s, with unix as OS dedicated to this machine
- 15.03.1969 Busicom and Intel signing a deal
- Intel was making memories
- Bob Noyce, founder of Inter is a co-inventor of integrated circuit in the early 50s
- An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor material that is normally silicon. 
- that deal with busicom was to develop 16 different ICs for calculators with built-in printers
- this was **way too expensive** > Ted Hof suggests to design a single IC with extensive programming capabilities to force the machine do what you need
- the result is **INTER 4004**, the first microprocessor (4bit, 740 kHz, 2300 tranzistors) 
- 4-bit architecture means that microprocessors were able to process units of 4 bits
- i4004 had not separated data and address bus
- i4004 is launched in 1971
- 1972, Gary Kildall arrives to Intel
- 1972, 8-bit i8008 is introduced and computers based on it show up, Micral made in France is first microcomputer
- the basic idea of i8008 is still in today's CPUs
- Kildall creates PL/M, first programming language for microcomputers
- 1974, i8080, 2MHz, 64 kB RAM
- Kildall suggests the implementation of **disk drives**, developed by IBM for their mainframes
- Kildall suggests a naming convention for the **file system** with filename and extension
- Kildall creates **BIOS**
- as a results, Kildall creates the first **modern OS**
