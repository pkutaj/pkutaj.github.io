## usecase
The concern is documenting my rules for docs driven ops, inspired by test driven development and expectation of Uncle Bob for 100% code coverage. This is about 100% docs coverage of operations. You don't need a tech writer in support same as you don't need a QA persion for code. The responsibility is ours to take.

### 1. rants
* each usecase has dedicated doc
* each usecase has a timestamped filename
* fast search, terminal and vscode, unix philosophy
* modular approach, clean code and keeping it all small
* pomodoro timeboxes, remember agile 
* you make a fool of yourself
* you must teach what you learn, like Jordan Peterson explaning Bible
* you must practice deliberatelly and go deep 
* you must not hurry, one of the things Nietzsche nailed
