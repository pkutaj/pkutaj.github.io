### Hemingway on Writing: Re-Read → Edit (Refactor) → Create → Stop before exhaustion (difficult!) → Don't worry when not working

* The best way is always to stop when you are going good
* The best way is always to stop when you know what will happen next
* If you do that every day when you are writing a novel you will never be stuck
* Always stop when you are going good 
* Then, donʼt think about it. Don't worry about it 
* Start to write the next day. 
* That way your subconscious will work on it all the time
* But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it 
* Your brain will be tired before you start
* Once you are into the novel it is as cowardly to worry about whether you can go on 
* Similar about worrying about having to go into inevitable action. 
* You have to go on, so there is no sense to worry. 
* You have to learn the above to write a novel. 
* The hard part about a novel is to finish it.
* The best way is to read it all every day from the start, 
    - correcting as you go along
    - going on from where you stopped the day before
* When it gets so long that you canʼt do this every day:
    - read back two or three chapters each day
    - then each week read it all from the start.
* Thatʼs how you make it all of one piece. 
* Again, remember to stop while you are still going good. 
* That keeps it moving instead of having it die whenever you go on and write yourself out
* When you do that you find that the next day you are pooped and canʼt go on.

* refactor mercilessly (extreme programming)
* night shift of mathematicians (cormack mccarthy)
* have life to write about
* don't be an amateur (pressfield, cal newport)
