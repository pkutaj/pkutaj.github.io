## findings
### (3) functions of memory manager
1. **MAPS** virtual addresses ðŸ Š physical addresses (done by the CPU)
2. **PAGE FILES** usage to back up pages that **CANNOT FIT** to physical memory
    * physical memory is limited and expensive
    * if you need to allocate more, you need to use the persistent storage (disk)
3. provide **MEMORY SERVICES** to other system components
    * allocate, free, reserve memory

### pages
* memory is not managed in bytes ðŸ Š that would cost much overhead
* memory is managed in larger chunks called **PAGES**
* page size is **DETERMINED ONLY BY CPU**, not by OS
* all memory services are **PER-PAGE-SERVICES** ðŸ Š you can't just allocate 10 bytes, you are allocated an entire page
* 2-page sizes are supported

### (3) states of a page
* if a 32-bit process starts and has 2GB of virtual address space that it can use to allocate inro

#### STATE-1. Free
* unallocated page
* any access to that page causes Access Violation exception ðŸ Š kills the process

#### STATE-2. Committed
* allocated page that can be accessed
* no Access Violation there
* Page may not be in physical memory, it may be paged out to the page file
* may have a backup on disk (pagefile, dll)

#### STATE-3. Reserved
* in-between
* technically un-allocated ðŸ Š if access, Access Violation
* but this address space will not be used by anything until released
* canonical use: thread stack. the stack is not allocated upfront. is reserved (1MB is reserved). Stack has to be contiguous in virtual memory. That reservation must be kept until done. 

#### demo (VmMap): memory types, page states
1. select process you want to look at
2. UI displays the virtual address space of that process

* see comments for some of the types used

TYPE        | COMMENT
------------|-----------------------------------------------
image       | files, usually DLLs, used by the process
mapped file | files mapped by **MEMORY-MAPPED FILE OBJECTS**
stacks      | see the image below

### sharing
* **RAM is the most precious resource**
* the address space per process is in TB, but this is enormous compared to the physical memory that we have
* my machine is running on 16GB of physical memory
* pages can be **SHARED** across processes â€” for the same code, referenced from the same virtual memory address
* example scenario: `kernel32.dll` can be shared across 100 processes as it is common to many processes 

![sharing_memory_across_processes]({{ site.url }}/assets/img000855.png)

#### what is shared?
- [x] code pages based on the same images (5 instances of `mspaint.exe`)
- [x] DLL code loaded in the same addresses
- [x] data pages (read/write) 
    * by default special protection called `copy-on-write` exception which copies data as a separate page for a process that wants to edit the data
- [x] data pages can be created without `copy-on-write`

#### demo (process explorer)
* find DLL view ðŸ Š show Base, Image Base columns
* `Base` displays the address that DLL is mapped into this particular processes address space
* find a common system .dll such as `kernel32.dll` 
* note the address **0x00007FFE4D810000** that that 64-bit dll shares accross processes, i.e. they are all sharing the chunk of the memory to use this system DLL

* note also the difference between **BASE** and **IMAGE BASE**
    * Image Base: the address that the image would like to load into ðŸ Š **PREFERRED ADDRESS**
    * Base: the actual address used 
* if the are identical, it is optimal for performance, if they are different linking happened

### (2) spaces of virtual memory: user and system
* each process has
    * own unique **PRIVATE ADDRESS SPACE** â€” similar as it has it private handle table
    * shared identical **SYSTEM ADDRESS SPACE** is part of the entire address space that is visible â€” but not accessible by the application (handles only)
* kernel is singleton ðŸ Š the higher ranges look the same for each process
* the layout depends on the **BITNESS** of the OS and the specific process
* in the space, there are say dedicated ranges 

#### (32-bit) space

#### (64-bit) space

![virtual_address_space_layout]({{ site.url }}/assets/img000858.png)

* 64-bit architecture can reach to 2^64 ðŸ Š 16EB ðŸ Š unimaginable
* current CPU architectures only support 58 bits addressing 256 TB
* current kernel implementation can work with 16TB at most ðŸ Š windows 10 enterprise can work with 6TB

### address translation
* CPU is configured upfront to understand virtual addresses
* old CPUs like 8086 worked only with REAL mode
* starting with 386, CPU needs to go through translation
* CPU gets some information to do the translation
    1. page directory per process 
    2. bunch of page tables
    3. translation lookaside buffer
