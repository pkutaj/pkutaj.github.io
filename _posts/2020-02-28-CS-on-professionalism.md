## findings
### context
 * the fillowing are the rules of professionalism
 * 1946 to now, number of programming exponential rate
 * every five years there is a doubling of the number of programmers
 * half the programmers have less than five years of experience
 * we are constantly inexperience
 * the old programmers are still here, but hordes of 20s old have been pouring in
 * there is a responsibility for newcomers just for the care for the craft
 
### (1) never submit shit
* the first issue to be overcome
* people now regularly download betas
* tough bananas boys - this is the attitude
* do you believe code must have bugs, it must be infested? 
* we must know it works, to the best of our ability
* not guess/hope it works or hopes it won't break soon 
* solid code, tested, clean, organized

### (2) always be ready
* 2-week sprints are usual
* programmers for mercury space capsule had an iteration length of 1 day
* unit tests in the morning, passed in the afternoon
* every 2 weeks we have to be ready to deploy
* it may not have enough features to deploy, but it's ready to deploy
* this means: testing is done; documentation is done, everything for the current set of features is completed
* at the end of the sprint, the state is deployable/submittable
* what about burning periods or stabilization periods

### (3) produce at a stable pace
* the longer the project goes the slower you DON'T get
* you don't slow down with project's age
* feature production rate does not slow down
* the reason we slow down is that we make the mess

### (4) adapt inexpensively
* the cost of the change has to be symmetrical to the size of the change, from the point of view of a user
* you can't complain that the system is ruined if a small change is requested
* keep software changeable
* clean and testable

### (5) continuous improvement
* the code should be getting better with time, it should mature not fall into entropy and fall into disorder
* we need to cultivate code
* not o to rot

### (6) fearless competence
* you see code and you don't want to touch the mess, because if you touch it and break it, it's yours
* that cannot be the reaction to the code, that is a fearful reaction
* we cannot choose to minimize our personal risk

### (7) no dumping on QA
* QA is not the group that finds bugs
* old rule: I meet any deadline if the code does not have to work. 
* QA should find nothing
* why QA depts? because of the burn that happened
* the function of QA is to specify how the system should behave, not to be in the back of the process wanting for buggy code to be tested
* a manual test plan is a hell
* QA always under hellish pressure with time
* QA belongs to the beginning, devs should guarantee a clean system
* if a computer can do it, computers should do it
* how do you know QA 

### (8) work as a team
* teams cover for each other if a player goes down
* someone needs to be able to step in if you're out

### (9) give honest estimates
* the most honest: I don't know
* the shape of the unknown is definable
* PERT: project evaluation in real-time
* 3 numbers estimate:
* 1. if all goes right - 1 week
* 2. if all goes normal - 3 weeks
* 3. if all goes wrong - 8 weeks
* if you don't know you can make it, don't absorb the request
