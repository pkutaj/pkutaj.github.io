### 1. initializer is not a constructor
* initializer is a function that configures the instance at the point of its creation
* aka **initialization method**
    - is optional 
    - optionality is part of the slightly anarchic bend of Python's design
* code: `__init__(self, <object_init_params>)`
* **it is not** a constructor; it is **used by** a constructor:
    - constructor already exists at the time then initializator is called
    - constructor is handled by python runtime system
    - one of the things constructor does is to check if initializer is present
    - initializer is called by a constructor as part of the new-object process

### 2. it must contain the self keyword in params
* the concept of the `self` keyword is analogous to `this` in C#, Java, C++, JS

### 3. there is no return object
* initializer does not return anything
    - it just modifis an object refered to by `self` 
    - just as we do not declare vars before assignment (there are languages where a declaration statement is separate from an assignment statement)
    - in Python, we do not need to declare object attributes before assignment 

### 4. underscored attributes
* [GH: Underscored-Vars-in-Python-Initializers.md][#3]
* [local: Underscored-Vars-in-Python-Initializers.md][#4]

### 5. often contains class invariants
* good practice for an initializer to establish
* truths about an object that endure during for its lifetime 
* often: test & `raise` the incom

```python
def __init__(self, number):
        """ class invariants """
        if not number[:2].isalpha():
            raise ValueError(f"No airline code in '{number}")
        if not number[:2].isupper():
            raise ValueError(f"Inalid airline code '{number}'")
        if not (number[2:].isdigit() and int(number[2:]) <= 9999):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid route number '{number}'")

        self._number = number

```
