## findings
* **every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation in the system**

1.	Conditionals instead of polymorphism
2.	Copy-pasted duplicate code
3.	Duplicate logic in multiple locations
4.	Magic strings

6.	Repeated if-then logic
7.	Repeated execution patterns
8.	Static methods everywhere
