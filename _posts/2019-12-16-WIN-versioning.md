## the case	
the question is how is the windows versioning changing

## findings
### - windows versioning
* And with the introduction of the Windows Insider Program for PC and the Insider program for Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft promises to continue **rapidly developing Windows 10**. 
* *What does this mean ?* 
    * ➔ to better identify a release of Windows 10, the **version number + build number will be the best place to look**.
    * run `winver` 
* Windows 10, version 1809 means September 2018 release
* There are 2 major feature releases per annum, 03 and 09
* See [Windows lifecycle fact sheet - Windows Help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)
    * withing versions there are builds starting with the year -1 

#### version number
* starting with windows 10 November Update, MS changed its verioning system based on a year and month scheme
* the original releate of win10 is therefore 1507
* Windows will no longer have identifiable version numbers such as a Windows 11 or Windows 12. 
* these are called **feature updates**, usually semi-anually
* besides there are **quality updates**, usually monthly

#### build number
* compilation of the OS at a particular **point in time**
    * MS compiles a new build of win10 every day and there are many branches and build labs at the company that handles this procedure
    * Build numbers don't have that much meaning, sometimes they jump
* this one build is called **RTM** ➔ ready to manufacture
