* record when the **tips** of branches and other references were updated in the **LOCAL REPO**

### 1. Instructions
* Run `git reflog`
* Run `git checkout -b <recoverBranch> <sha>`
    - the name of the `<recoverBranch>` is **IRRELEVANT & CUSTOM**
    - the `sha` is **CRUCIAL & FIXED** 
    - you may have to commit/stash all changes in the working area before creating a detached head
    - e.g. `git checkout -b restoreTests 284270a`
* Recover data by placing them somewhere else
* Return to `master` by `git checkout master`
* Delete the ad-hoc branch by `git branch -D <recoverBranch>`
