## the case	of filtering results 
the question is how can you filter comfortably in various manners

## findings
```sql
SELECT column --> attribute
FROM table --> table
WHERE --> some kind of a filter on a row, some criteria so you don't get all rows
```

### Equality and relational operators
 * `=` is **EQUALITY OPERATOR** in SQL
    * in other programming languages, `=` is an **ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR** (is assigs the left side of the operator to the right side of the operator, whereas compare asks if the right side is identical with the left side and tell you 0 or 1)

### Set theory and Boolean operators: AND, OR

![sql_where_boolean_logic]({{ site.url }}/assets/sql-where-05.png)

###  IN + NOT IN (Single-column search)
* this is traditionally used in subqueries


#### IN
* if you have multiple criteria for a single column --> instead of writing ORs (criteria), you can batch them under IN

#### NOT IN
* returns all except the criteria

### BETWEEN
* you can filter on a range,
* with using relational operators + set operators (AND / OR) 
* the lower value has to be first
* also used with `NOT`
* Example: Review ratings should only be 1-5. Find all the invalid ratings in one query

```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM reviews 
 WHERE rating 
   NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
```

### LIKE — Not strict matches, Yes %
* `%` is the wildcard character in SQL,
* that's why is so widely used in SDE ticketing tool that is writing queries on the backend when you are doing the FE selections in GUI
* LIKE is case insensitive
* strict matches are case sensitive

#### LIKE AND

### IS NULL; IS NOT NULL
* IS NULL means empty cell
* if looking for empty cells (go to special blanks) -->
* you cannot use equality relational operator
* looking for all filled cells, use `IS NOT NULL`

### SQL VIEWS
* instead of repeating complex queries, you can create a view in a single rather complex query and then just call it
* good for permissions handling, when you want to give access to the chunk of information, not all of it
