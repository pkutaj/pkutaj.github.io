## findings
### (1) definition
* **AUTOMATES** the process of deploying and scaling workloads on EC2

SERVICE   | MODEL
----------|--------------------------
ec2       | **Infra as a Service**
beanstalk | **Platform as a Service**

* Beanstalk is **Platform as a Service** ðŸ Š there are constraints for supported technologies

### (2) technologies
- [x] leverages existing AWS services
- [x] only pay for the other services you leverage
- [x] handles: 
    1.  provisioning
    2.  load balancing
    3.  scaling
    4.  monitoring

### (3) 8x supported application platforms
1. Java
2. .NET
3. PHP
4. Node.js
5. Python
6. Ruby
7. Go
8. Docker
    * you can set up Docker container with another technology and it should work

### (4) why choose Beanstalk
- [x] monitoring is included
- [x] deployment is critical
- [x] scaling
    * handles upcoming new demand
    * additional config can be added
- [x] ec2 customization
    * stretches behind PaaS here

### (5) Use Cases
> Itâ€™s not that hard to understand there is an overhead every time you want to create a test bench for a simple service with database access because you have to set up the EC2 instance, the database, the security groups, VPC, optionally load balancing and auto-scaling. Amazon came up with a great idea to compose these things together into a new service called Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is a service to easily deploy an application with the usual needs, EC2 instances where the app will run, database, scaling, load balancing, etc.

* deploy an app with minimal knowledge of other services
* reduce the overall maintenance needed for the application
    * if you can fit into a templated use case
* making sense if just a few customizations are required
