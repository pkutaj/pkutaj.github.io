### 1. intro notes
* context: written for scenario of publishing markdown documents to zendesk
* rule (variation of phrases): 
    - do not pollute shared spaces 
    - do not contaminate remote repos — even your own remote branch
* this can be for both unit/integration testing 
    - for me, I use mostly for integration

### 2. steps
* run your tests
* open VSC
* run the command _Discard all Changes_
    - or open _SCM_ sidebar → Right-Click on _Changes_ → _Discard all Changes_
* start again
