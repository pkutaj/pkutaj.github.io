## usecase
The concern is documenting the more useful way of detecting device-specific capabilities from HTTP headers known as **client hints** that is replacing **user agent header**

> In 2020, Google announced that they would be phasing out support for the User-Agent header in their Google Chrome browser. They stated that other major web browser vendors were supportive of the move, but that they did not know when other vendors would follow suit.[15] Google stated that a new feature called Client Hints would replace the functionality of the User-Agent string.
