## abstract
The concern is documenting instant messaging tactics â€” mostly focused on notification processing (have church bells ever been a distraction).

## findings
* I find this crucial as this controls the levels of dopamines that destroy the descent into the depths of thought
    * It destroys the slowness
    * It destroys the laziness
    * It destroys the boringness
    * It destroys the historical consciousness
    * there rules are to be applied forcefully

### 1. notification minimalism
* you start with the ideal of working with no notifications â€” not with the question of what notificatinos you want to remove
    * kudos to konmari! 
* I mean, no semantics, just signalling

### 2. notification centralization
* you need to know if that's ok, but during the **SESSION** you do not go there, that is verboten
* I need history ðŸ Š `WIN+A` for checking the history of notifications in windows action center

### 3. no mobile notifications
* unless absolutely necessary
* if mobile, go via browser

### 4. slack shortcuts
* use mouse sparingly

AIM                 | SHORTCUT       | COMMENT
--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------
go to channel       | `CTRL+T`       |
**THREADS**         |                |
go to threads       | `CTRL+shirt+T` |
open thread         | NAVIGATE + `T` | navigate and open from there (you can use `T`)
toggle threads      | `CTRL + .`     | much used
edit older response | NAVIGATE + `E` |
**RESPONSE**        |                |
open emoji reaction | NAVIGATE + `R` |

### 5. sounds
* ideally something semantic reminding of the need for staying focused like a church bell
* I keep the [Get Church Bells Tower from Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/church-bells-tower/9pfqbhn18h4k?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) as company to let me know about the state of the **SESSION**
