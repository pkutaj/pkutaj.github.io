## usecase
The concern is documenting characters that have started to bug me when checking Nomad allocation logs initially. 

```
[0m[1mmodule.redshift.module.cluster.aws_redshift_cluster.cluster[0]: Still modifying... 
```

* what are these characters `[0m[` ?

This would not be a problem is that is piped into `out-host`

```
module.redshift.module.cluster.aws_redshift_cluster.cluster[0]: 
```

### 1. notes
* there are **TERMINAL CONTROL CHARACTERS**
* in other places, this can be fixed by removing colors
* for nomad, however, even running with `nomad alloc logs -no-color _ALLOC_ID_` does not change it
* i have to pipe it to `out-host` cmdlet (alias `oh`) to make it work again

```
nomad alloc logs -no-color _ALLOC_ID_ | oh
```

### 2. function alias to make this fast
* this is now living in my `$profile` 

```powershell
function get-nomadLogs ($jobId, $paging) { 
    $nomadLogs = nomad alloc logs -job $jobId 
    if ($paging) { oh -InputObject $nomadLogs -Paging }
    else { oh -InputObject $nomadLogs }
}
Set-Alias n get-nomadLogs
```

* specific for this is that I am getting a job id from the slack bot (running jobs )
