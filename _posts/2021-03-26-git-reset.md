## usecase
The concern is documenting the conceptualization of `git reset`

### 1. why confusing?
1. you need to understand
    * 3 main areas of git (work, index, repo)
    * branching
2. it has many usecases

### 2. what does it do?
#### 2.1. in general: 4 ways of moving a branch
1. commit
2. merge
3. rebase  
4. pull

* however, **NONE OF THEM IS A SPECIALIZED COMMAND TO MOVE BRANCHES** explicitly
* these 4 general ways to move a branch is a _side-effect_ of the commands aimed at something totally different

#### 2.2. enter git reset: fifth & specialized way to move a branch
* usually current branch

1. pick a branch
2. run `git reset`
3. that branch becomes the current commit → the branch is taken "back in time"
4. notice that HEAD is not moved — still pointing to the same branch. Branch is moving

#### 2.3. confusing part and 3 types of reset: hard, mixed, soft
* not what it does to the repo
* what it does to the remaining 2 areas

##### 2.3.1. git reset --hard

![hard_copies_from_repo_to_both]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001557.png)

Command                   | Comment
--------------------------|-------------------------------------
`git reset --hard HEAD`   | going back to HEAD
`git reset --hard HEAD^`  | going back to the commit before HEAD
`git reset --hard HEAD~1` | equivalent to "^"
`git reset --hard HEAD~2` | going back two commits before HEAD

* usecases:
    - committed in wrong branch

##### 2.3.2. git reset --mixed
* or just `git reset`
* if `--mixed` → this is the default option 

![mixed_copies_from_repo_to_index_only]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001791.png)

* `git reset` therefore **undoes** the staging of files

##### 2.3.3. git reset --soft
* if `--soft` → touch neither index nor working area
    * just move the branch in a repo and leave index and working area untouched

### 3. how can you lose files? don't commit your changes & run git reset --hard 
* this seems to me irreversible (just done it by mistake and it hurts)

1. you commit a file
2. you change the file in the working area and do not commit it
3. you run `git reset --hard` 
4. the branch is moved to the HEAD, and the state of that move is **copied both to the index and the working area**
5. if you made any changes to either work or index, that's all **irreversibly lost** 
6. rule: no commit, no restore
