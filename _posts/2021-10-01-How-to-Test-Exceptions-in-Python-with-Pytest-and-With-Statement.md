## usecase
The aim of this pageüìù is demonstrate the syntax for python unit tests (pytest) that pass if an exception is thrown as expected. 
I have a function `validate_and_capitalize` where I pass a `section_name` and `section_folders` and I need to test if when an improper value is passed, the `ValueError` with given message is raised.

### 1. code

```python
import pytest
def test_validate_and_capitalize():
    section_folders = get_and_print_ZD_Guide_structure()
    section_name = "47 snow"
    with pytest.raises(Exception) as e:
        validate_and_capitalize(section_name, section_folders)
    assert "Provided section id does not seem to be incremeting an existing one" in str(e.value)
    assert e.type == ValueError
```

1. import `pytest`
2. pass `pytest.raises(Exception)` into `with` statement 
4. in the block, call the function that is expected to fail
5. assert exception type with `e.type == <exception_type>`, e.g. `assert e.type == ValueError`
6. if needed, assert error message `assert "<error_msg>" in str(e.value)`, e.g.
