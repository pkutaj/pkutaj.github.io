## Usecase
Documenting through the explanation of the syntax sugar within the SICP first lecture

### 1. "Sweet" function defitition
* in Scheme

```clojure
(define (square x)

    (* x x))
(square 10) → 100
```

![visual_explanation]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002403.jpg)

* now this looks similar to the assignment statement (in scheme)

```clojure
(define a (* 5 5))
```

### 2. "Proper" function defitition

> actually, this (the above) is a little bit confusing. This is how you use that but it is not very clear that you are naming something. 

```clojure
(define square (lambda (x) (* x x)))
```

* it does not say that hey you are defining the formula
* essential it makes clear — even though in a more clumsy form — that you are **naming** something
* it is you that are **choosing** these names and it is important to name **properly** 
* naming is a big deal and it is good to realize that is an articulate discreet step 
* in clojure this would be 

```clojure
(defn square [x] (* x x))

(square 10)

(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))

(square 10)
```
