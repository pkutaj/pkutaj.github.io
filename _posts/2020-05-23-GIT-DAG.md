## overview
The concern is to document the concept of DAG (directed acyclic graph) foundational for any distributed version control system (i.e. git, but also mercurial)

## findings
### (1) generic graph
* graphs consist of
    * **NODES**
    * **EDGES** lines joining those nodes together

* there are a more common types of graphs such as trees (hierarchical graph) or lists (with nodes having up to 2 pointers)

### (2) directed graph
* in a directed graph, edges have a defined direction
* this is because there is a **PARENT-CHILD** relationship going on here

### (3) acyclic directed graph
* means that if you follow the direction, you **CAN'T GET TO WHERE YOU STARTED**
* it is not a tree in that a node can have > 1 parent (the merge node see the merge node)

* DAGs can get complex pretty quickly

### (4) 4 types of nodes

### (5) DAG as version history
* commit is a node
