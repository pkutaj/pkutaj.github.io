### 1. what is CTE
* A CTE (Common Table Expression) is **TEMPORARY RESULT SET** 
* You can reference within another SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement
* i.e. you can build it and use in later query
* used in more complex queries
* they are **EXPRESSIONS**, i.e. they always return a value

### 2. syntax

### 3. benefits
* easy to learn
* code readibility
* named query gives you info about query results
* readable SQL is a big help to others and to you after 2 months
* modularity
* copy-pastable, re-usable
* CTEs can be pasted together
* better matches how you think about data analysis
