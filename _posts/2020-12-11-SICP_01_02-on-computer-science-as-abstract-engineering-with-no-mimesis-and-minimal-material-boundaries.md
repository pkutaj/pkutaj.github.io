## usecase

The aim is documenting SICP - lecture 1 - talkig about uniquess of computer science as being the abstract kind of engineering, thinking about (modern) abstract kind of visual arts in this respect.

<!-- /TOC -->

### 1. process and procedure
* belong to the realm of imperative knowledge
* procedure — language-specific expression of actions
    * language here: LISP / Clojure
* process — the instantiation of the procedure (by the computer, usually)

### 2. real problems of computer science
* the building of very large systems that cannot be held in heads all at once
* codebases with millions of lines

### 3. techniques for controlling complexity
* of large systems — this is what SICP / CS is about
* but also other areas deal with complexity
    * airliner, etc.

### 4. uniquess of complexity — abstract engineering
* the computer science is **not real, not physical**
* there is a different **contraints**
* there is no physical limitations that other engineering disciplines have to deal with
* CS deals with **idealized components** — there is not a large difference between
    * what can you build
    * what can you imagine
* CS is therefore **abstract form of engineering** — ignoring contraints imposed by reality
