## usecase
The aim of this explainerüí°/how-to-guideüèÅ is to add items `.gitignore` that have already been tracked. Usually, to ignore a file you just add it to `.gitignore` and you never stage/commit it. But you may change your mind or you may stage/commit in with `git add .`, etc.

### 1. steps
1. edit `.gitignore` 
2. run `git rm --cached <file>`. The removal of the file from the HEAD revision will happen on the next commit.
3. if you want to remove a whole folder, you need to remove all files in it recursively. Run `git rm -r --cached <folder>`

### 2. notes
* this will not remove the physical file from your local, but it does remove the files from other developers machines on next `git pull`
* as for `git rm`:

> When --cached is given, the staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to be removed from just the index.

> --cached
> Use this option to unstage and remove paths ONLY FROM THE INDEX. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.
