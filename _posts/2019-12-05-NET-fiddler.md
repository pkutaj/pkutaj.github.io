### General Fiddler
* fiddler is from microsoft
* appears in 2003
* eric lawrence was looking for a tool o watch for http traffic
* written in c#

### Why
* troublesthoot problems
    * start-up fiddler, make a request, look through fiddler why things may not be behaving correctly
* performance evaluation
    * how big and files are the filew
* **fiddle** with requests and responses
    * changes before request and responses are sent and see what happens
    * benefit is the security testing
* visualize page requests (timeline)
    * good overall feeling of how the page is performing
* periodic site review
    * is there anything in the request trace that is unexpected

### How
* proxy
    * attaches as a proxy to the browser
    * all traffic is routed to the localhost's fidler port (8888)
