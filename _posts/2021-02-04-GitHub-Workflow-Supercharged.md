### 1. traditional

![typical_workflow]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002524.jpg)

1. create a feature branch from master 
2. add commits
3. open pull requests â†’ showcase changes to other team members
4. discuss and review commits, or, add more commits if needed
5. once ready, deploy changes to the master branch; run tests; checkout changes into prod
6. merge into master when all looks good and delete feature branch

### 2. enriched

![enriched_workflow]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002525.jpg)

1. add **branch protection** to our master branch
2. you can set up continuous integration  (CI)
3. add another **branch protection** to our pull request to require a review before it can be merged
4. setup **continuous deployment** to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
5. require specific tests to pass for confirmation
6. merge branch into the base branch
