## findings
### (1) architectural style
* microservices are an architectural style
* autonomous + independently deployable services ...
* ...collaborate with the aim to form an application
* the name suggests services should indeed be small, but there is no official size limit

### (2) why microservices
* often contrasted with **MONOLITH**
* monolith is an application with a single codebase, running on a single host server and persists data into a single database with a consistent technology
    * all the code is in one place
    * only 1 thing to develop
    * only 1 think to update and maintain
* the problem is for one of scale â€” it works well for a small projects
    * many devs
    * many users
    * big data
    * difficult to maintain
    * technical debt
    * entangled and highly coupled modules
    * difficult to deploy, which is risky and needs downtime

### (3) communicating between microservices
* microservices publish messages on a **SHARED EVENT BUS** and subscribe to message from that **BUS**

* this promotes async communication between microservices
* if calls are coming from the client, the pattern can be used calling **API GATEWAY**

### (4) async communication
* usually a messaging queue/event bus is used for this function
