### abstract
The aim is documenting the security/networking concept of **certificate chain**

### (1) CA â€” the issuer
* certificate must be issued by a trusted party called **Certificate Authority Server**
* certificate authority is **public** and acknowledged by **vendors**

### (2) cert chain
* check any certificate within a browser (devtools ðŸ Š certificate ðŸ Š certificate path) and see the certificate chain consisting of
    * 1 **root** certificate
    * 1+ **intermediate** certificates 
    * 1 **server** certificate

* **certificate chain** is a chain of authority in certificates 
* we can do some mathematics to verify that the certificate was actually issued by a **CA** that is said it was (this verification is **SIGNING**)

#### (2.1) root cert
* offline
* in-OS
* root certs create intermediate certificates (physically on the vendor's side) 
* root certificate _signs_ the intermediate certificate each session to guarantee its origins

#### (2.2) intermediate cert
* online
    * in-browser
    * from-CA-server OR from endpoint-server
        * this being recommeneded as a best practice

* intermediate cert creates server cert at the time of its issue 
* intermediate cert _signs_ server cert each session
* if you need to export an intermediary certificate follow [How to Download an Intermediate Cert From Browser â€“ Kemp Support](https://support.kemptechnologies.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002427603-How-to-Download-an-Intermediate-Cert-From-Browser)

#### (2.3) server cert
* online
    * in-browser
    * from-endpoint server 
    * contains domain
* passed during the session after it is signed by an intermediary cert
* after it is verified that it is issued by the downloaded intermediate certificate
* ...it is downloaded
* and public-private key exchange can begin

### (3) expiry
* all of the certificates have expiry dates
* usually we talk about server cert expiry
