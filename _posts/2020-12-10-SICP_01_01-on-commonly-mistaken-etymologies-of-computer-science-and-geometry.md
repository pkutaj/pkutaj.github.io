### 1. computer science and geometry
* not about computers same as
    * physics is not about particle accelerators
    * biology is not about microscopes
    * geometry is not about using surveiling instruments
* geometry is from

> gaia + metron; measuring the earth; surveiling

* the reason for that is that Egyptian priesthood developed the methodology in order to restore the boudaries of fields destroyed by the floddings of the Nile
* so for Egyptians geometry was about the use of surveiling instruments
* and for we have the same term for computer science 
* the field is getting started and you don't understand is
* so you mistake 
    * the essence
    * the tools — you think tools are the essence
* what are essences of geometry and computer science
    * looking into those tools, they are rididulous
    * the insights about the **formalization of the notions of space and time** are breath-taking
    * Egyptians started talking about **mathematical truth formally/precisel**, made first forarrays into axiomatic method
    * Egyptians started to **formalizae intuitions about declarative knowledge — what things are**
* what are essences of computer science
    * starting to learn how to **formalize intuitions about process — how to do things**
    * talking precisely about how-to-knowledge

### 2. the dynamics of geometry

> Until the 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to Euclidean geometry,[a] which includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve, as fundamental concepts.[2]

### 3. example of declarative/categorical
* this exactly tells you what is the square root of x

* this is not telling you at all how to go and find one

### 4. example of imperative
* finding square root by success of averaging
