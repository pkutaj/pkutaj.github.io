## usecase
The aim of this how-to-guideüèÅ is to create a memorable 6-step instruction for the modification of a YAML file. 
I am using [oyaml ¬∑ PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/oyaml/) to work with yaml objects in Python to keep the order or `yaml` items identical before and after manipulations.

### 1. steps/?

1. `import oyaml as yaml`
2. access resource in read mode with open(`<file>`, rt, utf8) as `<fileAlias>`:
3. create `<object>` by loading the existing yaml with `<object>` = yaml.load(`<fileAlias>`, Loader=yaml.Loader)
4. modify `<object>` and close the block
5. access resource in a write mode with open(`<file>`, wt, utf8) as `<fileAlias>`:
6. dump object back to `<fileAlias>`.write(yaml.dump(`<object>`)) and close the block
