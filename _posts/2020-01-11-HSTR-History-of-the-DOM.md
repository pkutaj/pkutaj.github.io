title: History > The late 90s, DOM born out of WAR (browser war 1)
---
* The DOM started amids the first browser WAR. 
* this was called DOM level-0. 
* Now (1995-ish) the **web is flat**, JavaScript is in development in two separate camps and there is some need for interactivity. 
    * Nothing is standardised and only a few of the elements have interactive elements. 
* DOM was originally thought of largely in terms of browsers and it wanted to solve problems in the context of **browser wars of the 90s**
* DOM originated as a **spec to allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to be portable among web browsers**
* Dynamic HTML was the immediate ancestor of the Document Object Model. 
* However, when the Document Object Model Working Group was formed (1998), it was also joined by vendors in other domains, including HTML or XML editors and document repositories. 
    * Several of these vendors had worked with SGML before XML was developed
    * As result, the Document Object Model has been influenced by SGML Groves and the HyTime standard. 
    * Some of these vendors had also developed their own object models for documents in order to provide programming APIs for SGML/XML editors or document repositories, and these object models have also influenced the Document Object Model.
* In 2005, after 10 years, there is standard support for this model
