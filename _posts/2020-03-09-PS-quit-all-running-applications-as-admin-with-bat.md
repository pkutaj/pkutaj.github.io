## findings
### run as admin from powershell

```powershell
Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs "-Command `"cd '$pwd'; & 'PathToPS1File';`""
```

### run as admin from command line

```bat
powershell.exe -Command Start-Process PowerShell -ArgumentList '-File C:\demo\MyScript.ps1'
```

### put it to the start-menu
* create a shortcut of the `.bat file`
* move it to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`
* find in the start menu
* pin to start

1. `gps | ...`                                                        | get all running processes
2. `... | ? {$_.MainWindowTitle} | ...`                               | filter for applications by checking which of them was main windows title property
3. `... | ... | % {if($_.ProcessName -ne "powershell") {kill $_.Id}}` | test if it is not powershell, kill all except powershell (to avoid killing this process)
4. `kill -n explorer`                                                 | restart explorer (not included in the above point)
5. `write-host $outro`                                                | write outro message / ASCUU art
6. `pause`                                                            | press any key to continue...
7. `exit`                                                             | kill powershell as well finally
