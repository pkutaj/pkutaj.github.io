## the case	
the question is:instead of going into renaming files as `_old` I would like to commit first and then undo it if I need to revert to the previous version

## findings
### undo local uncommited changes
* If working on something and you just don't want to create `.old`, i.e. you just want to be able to go to the last commit of that file
* At this point there are 3 options to undo the local changes you have:
    1. Discard all local changes, but save them for possible re-use later: `git stash`
    2. Discarding local changes (permanently) to a file: `git checkout -- <file>`
    3. Discard all local changes to all files permanently: `git reset --hard`
* **note:** executing `git reset --hard`, keep in mind that there is also a way to just temporary store the changes without committing them using git stash. This command resets the changes to all files, but it also saves them in case you would like to apply them at some later time. You can read more about it in section below.

### undo local staged and commited changes before push
* I hit a wrong button in VSCode sometimes and I commit everything
* Then I need to undo that step in a terminal quickly
* run `git reset --hard HEAD^` 
* If multiple commits from the top, you can run git `reset --hard HEAD~2` to remove the last two commits. 
* You can increase the number to remove even more commits.
