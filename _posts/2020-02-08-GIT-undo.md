* the question is how to undo the things in git
* currently, **3 RESETS AND 1 CHECKOUT**

## findings

### (1) RESET ➔ git reset HEAD: undo the stage

### (2) RESET ➔ git reset --soft HEAD~1: undo the commit, keep the stage

> scenario: I stage 50 small changes, commit them in bulk and push it to the jekyll pages. The build fails. I need to undo the commit and start analyzing where it went wrong. 

* you have staged many files
* you commit them at once from the **INDEX** into **HEAD**
* UNDO just the commit and put it all back to the index, you move the **HEAD** to the commit before
* this brings files back to INDEX
* this does not change any files themselves


### (3) RESET ➔ git reset --hard HEAD~1: undo the commit; undo the stage; keep files 

> scenario: I hit a wrong button in VSCode sometimes and I stage or even commit everything

* Then I need to undo that step in a terminal quickly
* run `git reset --hard HEAD^` 
* If multiple commits from the top, you can run git `reset --hard HEAD~2` to remove the last two commits. 
* You can increase the number to remove even more commits.

###  (4) CHECKOUT ➔ git checkout: undo local uncommitted file changes
* **DANGEROUS**

>scenario: working on something and you just don't want to create `.old`, i.e. you just want to be able to go to the last commit of that file

* Commit (i.e. **CHECK-IN**) version_1 that would like to use as a restore point
* Start working and experimenting
* Discarding local changes (permanently) to a file: `git checkout -- <file>`
* The file will be **OVERWRITTEN**
