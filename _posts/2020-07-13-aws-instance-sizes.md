### 1. large
* rule of thumb: a "large" instance of any type has 2 vCPUs
* with each size larger (xlarge, 2xlarge, 4xlarge etc.) being a multiplier on the number of vCPUs (4, 8, 16 etc.) 
* the baseline RAM for that type is scales accordingly
* the cost of the next larger instance also roughly doubles the previous sizeâ€™s cost.


### 2. redshift example
* I am working mostly with redshifts thus the example
