## findings
### break functions into sections
- AAAfunction
    - arrange 
    - act
    - assert - test result
- does not PS has something like this  ?
- unit tests are normally tenish lines

### the smaller function the better focus

### long name is better than a long comment
- if u have to write a super long comment in order to exolain what the function is doing, therew is something wrong

### on arguments (2 max)
- never more than 2
- there are scenarios where functions are ammended and you end up with 12 functions
- monadic - do this or don't do this

### either do or answer, not both
- don't mutate states

### on error handling
- prefer exceptions to err codes
- dude, sql server's sp
- it's dated
- try should be beginning
- catch is the very end
- error handling to one thing - 

### don't duplicate code
- DRY
- duplication leads to bugs if a piece of code gets changed and others not - often

### readibility over shortness of code: always
