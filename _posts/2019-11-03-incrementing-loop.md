title: Programming > loop as incrementing / decrementing function
categories: [programming]
---
* there are different types of loops, but almost every  loop needs a **loop variable**
    * loop variable that is declared outside of loop
    * loop variable that changes within a loop
    * loop variable which works as a criterion for the loop termination (`i` conventionally)
* loop works as **incrementing or decrementing function**
    * maps set of program variables into an integer
    * when loop is entered, value is non-negative
    * when value is <= 0, loop terminates
    * value is decreated every time time through loop
