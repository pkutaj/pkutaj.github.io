## usecase
The concern is documenting terminology surrounding **if statements**

> it's important to get names for the part of things and expressions. one of the things that every sorcerer tell you that if you know the name of the spirit, you have power over it

### 1. predicate expression
* To evaluate an IF expression:
    1. Evaluate the **predicate expression** aka condition
    2. Execute action
        2.1 If it yields `true` evaluate te **consequent expressions**
        2.2 Otherwise evaluate the **alterative expression**

* a predicate is a linguistic (syntactical) concept and is the imperative/dynamic primitive of each proposition/sentence (subject being the declarative/categorical primitive)

### 2. logical value
* predicate expression contains a logical/truth value
    * true
    * false
* to bring this further, each language also assigns logical values to most of expressions that do not carry the direct logical value 
* this is **truthy** and **falsy**

### 3. example: powershell 

* let's see truthy and falsy in powershell

```powershell
# CHROME runs, EDGE does not
▶ if(gps edge) {write-host "truthy"} else {write-host "falsy"}
Get-Process: Cannot find a process with the name "edge". 
falsy

▶ if(gps chrome) {write-host "truthy"} else {write-host "falsy"}
truthy
```
* the expression `gps edge` is a **predicate expression** but it is not straightforward `false`
* ...because that is a command, not an strict test
