## findings
### (1) account setup
* use a free tier
* first, visit the **BILLING SERVICE**
* create a budget **ALERT** to make sure you don't get charged

### (2) traditional data centers (on-premise)
* is an organization is building a global service they need: the idea is that this traditional data centers take **large up-front investments**
* **long time** to build the data center itself
* they need to provision servers
    * web servers
    * file servers
    * DB server 
* they expand into other regions ðŸ Š new data center needs to repeat the process
* forecasting demand is difficult so the large up-front investment is risky
* it is slow 
* maintenance is expensive

### (3) cloud benefits
- [x] trade capital expense for variable expense
    * you pay only for the time you use the server
- [x] benefit from massive economies of scale
    * AWS buys at scale, is getting better prices and manages at scale
    * these cost savings gets to consumers
- [x] stop guessing capacity â€” elasticity
- [x] increate speed and agility
    * testing and providing the minimal viable product is cheaper
- [x] stop spending maintaining data centers
- [x] go global in minutes without the need to build new DCs

### (4) terminology
#### (4.1) elasticity
* ability to acquire resources as you need them and release them you no longer need that â€” automatically

#### (4.2) reliability
* solutionsâ€™ ability to provide functionality for users when it is needed
* maximized for fall-overs in outages

#### (4.3) agility
* lowe the cost of trying new ideas or business processes
* reduces the time required to maintain infra â€” focus on business value
* reduces risk around security and compliance â€” there is **SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL**
* provides access to emerging technologies

### (5) types
* there is a spectrum between **MAXIMUM CONTROL** VS **MINIMUM MAINTENANCE**

#### (5.1) maximum control: IAAS
* **Infrastructure as a service**

- [x] run servers in the cloud similar to running servers in own DC
- [x] change OS
- [x] configure as you want
- [x] maintain those servers

#### (5.2) minimum maintenance: SAAS
* **Software as a Service**

- [x] no worries about configuring servers

#### (5.3) middle: PAAS
* **Platform as a Service**

- [x] service is configured for us
- [x] examle: wordpress with WP Engine on AWS
- [x] example: elastic beanstalk

### (6) deployment models
#### (6.1) public
- [x] AWS
- [x] GCP
- [x] Azure

#### (6.2) on-prem
* ownDC 
* with VMWare for managing your infrastructure 

#### (6.3) hybrid
* both public and on-prem (O365)
