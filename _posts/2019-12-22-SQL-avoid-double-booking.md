## the case	
the question is, what would be the logic to avoid double booking in a hotel (or a similar scenario)

<!-- /TOC -->

## findings
### the scenario
* Take as simple dataset as possible: 3 people booking 1 room 
* There is 1 error: Pavol and Jana are overlapping

###  solution 1: a simple subquery to find overlapping ones 
* use Subquery 


* Call the same table twice, remove comparing with itself with (same name) 
* Imagine 2 possible scenarios that intervals can't overlap (see below)

* Negate these 2 possible scenarios 
* There are many more scenarios how intervals can overlap, so it's much simpler to use via negativa

### solution 2: remodel dataset: row per day per customer
* Another answer is to remodel the table itself 
* Create a row for each day a guest is in the hotel

* Create a **natural primary key** combining 2 columns: room number and a day  
* In this way it gets impossible to create another combination of these values as primary keys are built-in constraints
