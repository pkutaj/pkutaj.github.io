title: AWS > ELB & ALB

## usecase
The concern is documenting the conceptualization of elastic load balancing and fast comparison of the three types of elastic load balancers:

1. ALB - application LB
2. NLB - network LB
3. CLB - classical LB

### 1. context
* belongs to the family of AWS network services, and in particular to load balancing services
* see <https://github.com/pkutaj/kb/blob/master/cloud/2020-06-27-cloud-aws-content-network-delivery-services.md>

### 2. ELB first
* all types are **ELASTIC** load balancers
* service
* managed devices
* simple to build out and set up the rules
* provisin in EC2 console
* the concept of **TARGET SERVERS** sitting behind ELB
* users hit load balancers to access application sitting on different server

### 3. etymology
* **APPLICATION** denotes the application layer of the TCP/IP stack

![application_layer_load_balancer]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001735.png)

* aka Layer 7 load balancing (in OSI model)
* designed and optimized for **HTTP/HTTPS**
* along with that comes SNI (Server Name Indication)
    * way to use single secure listener on load balancer
    * behind the LB there are different domains
    * you can present different SSL certs to the client based on the domain
    * this support multiple certificates for differnt domains
* IP addresses as targets
    * for hybrid clouds
* Lambda functions as targets

### 4. schemes: internet-facing, internal-facing
* there are 2 different schemes
* internet-facing

* internal-only â€” you can have **INTERNAL LOAD BALANCERS**

![internal-facing-LB]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001734.png)

### 5. healthchecks
* regardless, there are **HEALTHCHECKS** where load balancer is making sure that servers are up
* stop sending requests until it's healthy again
* you will not send traffic to the server is it is down
* perferct for HA and LB 

### 6. request routing 
* when you provision ELB, you'll get DNS name to access that infrastructure

```
<random>.<region>.elb.amazonaws.com
```

* you can access the aplication also by accessing the AWS-provided DNS name
* the reason this is done is because you'll have different public IP addresses for a FQDN
* the DNS name is **CNAME Alias**, not an A name
* this is what is usually an A Name
* this works also for internal LBs
* example with one of the internet facing ALBs used by Snowplow Analytics
