### 1. for KB
* using VSC as a **knowledge base**, too
* sometimes I need to find a string within workspace
* highlight the string
* use the command **Open Search editor to the side**
* create a shortcut (I use `ctrl+shift+alt+r`)

### 2. combine with search-in-shell
*  use [search-shell](https://github.com/pkutaj/kb/blob/master/powershell/2020-07-04-PS-search-shell.md) to find file fast
