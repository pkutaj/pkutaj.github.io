## the case	
the question is the crude generational comparison of software engineers on the base of the **ROBERT C MARTIN**'s (Uncle Bob's) lecture...

— [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnMItX2hEQ)

...interesting to read **PETER THIEL**'s review of ross douhat's book on decadence as a wider context...

— [Back to the Future](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/03/back-to-the-future)

...and finally to settle this into the tissue of **THOMAS KUHN**'s provocative concept of the  _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_

— [The Structure of Scientific Revolutions - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)

beware, this are simplistic high-level facts extracted from a narrative that fits the aims of Uncle Bob's agenda but the "facts" are simply fascinating

## findings
### (1950s) the 1st generation
* half is female
* no formal education
* the story begins in 1936, Turing writing the foundational paper
* Turing wrote code that would be recognized today 
* 1953 FORTRAN is created; line numbers or indentation still not invented
* code written on coding forms. handwritten, in pencil
* handed to key punchers whose job was a data entry 
* punchers typed code punched into cards, returned to programmers
* the deck was taken to the computer room
* programmers **were not allowed** to the computer room. 
* computer operators running the computer (physical separation of devs and ops) and put cards into a card reader
* turnaround time is 24 hours
* 1958 Lisp invented, first **functional language** (still alive in 2020)
* there are more programmers than computers, you have 10:1 ratios
* their background is institutional
* engineers were already matured pros who did not need lots of management and are trusted moved into the field
* "understood business, schedules, and deadlines"
* the transistor is born in the 1960s
* 1967 **OOP** with simula 67
* 1968 goto considered harmful, **structural programming**
* 1968 C + Unix coming out
* 1970, thousands of pdp8 coming out
* IBM360; 
* big things are done

### (1970s) the 2nd generation
* cs and ee programs institutionalized
* perception is this is THE career
* young + male (boys)
* discipline is replaced with high-energy and low-price
* process and management is needed 
* 1970s waterfall model created
* this is the default 1970s-2000s
* perpetual inexperience
