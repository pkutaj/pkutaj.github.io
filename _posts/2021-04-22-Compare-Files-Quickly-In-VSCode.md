## the case	
the question is, how to quickly compare two files in vscode and ideally, merge changes when needed

## toc
<!-- TOC -->

- [1. steps](#1-steps)
- [2. sources](#2-sources)

<!-- /TOC -->

### 1. steps
* there is only [beyond compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/) at the moment to do this kind of work more fluently
* I found a flow which is fastest for me, by first associating a keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+alt+c` to _Compare Active File With..._ 

1. Open or focus **target-file** 
2. Open or focus **source-file**.
3. Press `ctrl+shift+alt+c` â†’ a quick open menu **will be shown with target-file focused**.
4. **Press Enter**.

* Result: **source-file on left and target-file on right**
