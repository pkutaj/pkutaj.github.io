## Usecase
The aim is describe python's approach to opening/creating files

<!-- /TOC -->

### 1. On Resources
* resources are elements of a program that **must be** released/closed after use
* resource management is critical for proper program functioning
* **files** are a type of resources
* python provides special syntax and protocol to work with them

### 2. Open a file with open()
* `open()` is a built-in function to open a file
* there are three parameters

PARAM      | DESC
-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`file`     | required; filename
`mode`     | optional; explicit is better than implicit (read, write, append, binary, text)
`encoding` | optional;
 

### 3. Mode
* mode determines the exact type of object being opened 
* this is dynamic typing in action

MODE | MEANING
-----|-------------------
`r`  | open for reading
`w`  | open for writing
`a`  | open for appending

SELECTOR | MEANING
---------|------------
`t`      | text-mode
`b`      | binary-mode

* e.g. `wb` for write-binary, or `at` for append-text
* be explicit for the sake of readibility 


### 4. Encoding
 * getting the encoding right is crucial for properly encoding the content of the text file
 * if not specified, python will use the default encoding from 

 ```python
 import sys
 sys.getdefaultencoding()
 'utf-8'
 ```

 * that however, is not guaranteed and encoding should be checked properly

### 5. File-like object
* as said, mode determines the exact type
* in general, you can expect the object to support certain methods and contain certain properties

### 6. Test path idiom
In powershell, there is an simple idiom 

```powershell
if (test-path $file) {
    Invoke-Item $file
} else {New-Item $file}
```

... which checks if `$file` is there and then either opens it or creates it
How to go about this in Python ?

* you also use `open()` but in a different mode, in a writing mode
* if you invert the logic (if it does not exist, create the file)

```python
>>> import os
>>> docPath = ".\test.md"   
>>> os.path.exists(docPath)
False
# create and close
>>> f = open("test.md",'w') 
>>> f.close()
# test               
>>> docPath = "./test.md"   
>>> os.path.exists(docPath) 
True
>>> f.name
'test.md'
>>>
```

* note that the file object does not contain the path property

### 7. Path compatibility
* also it seems that not only you have universal newline
* but if you are within the python REPL/interpreter and you are not passing paths from windows shell, you can securely run with unix paths with forward slashes
