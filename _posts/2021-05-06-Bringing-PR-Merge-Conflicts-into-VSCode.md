### 1. steps/?
* I encounter merge conflicts within Pull Requests
* I want this to open as a git merge conflict in VSCode with the help of its _codeLens_  - there is no "button" to do this in GitHub! 
* ... and worse, not even in its PR extension, not in the GUI, just a tedious manual editor

1. `git checkout master`
2. run `git merge <branch>` â†’ select a branch you want to merge into `master`
3. now - you can deal with the merge hell from the git side-bar â†’ _Merge Changes_ 
4. make the changes with with the help of _codeLens_ 
5. commit changes â†’ merged 

Done + the PR disappears, too.
