## findings
### object manager
* object manager is part of the executive â€”  the upper layer of the kernel
- [x] creates **OBJECTS**
- [x] deletes **OBJECTS** 
- [x] tracks  **OBJECTS**
* objects are stored in a **TREE**
    * accessible with a tool called **WinObj** from SysInternals suite

### user-mode clients
* user-mode clients cannot get to the data structures that are loaded in memory
    * is in the kernel
    * you don't want user applications to be aware of the internal structure of objects
    * ðŸ Š use **HANDLES**

### kernel-mode clients
* kernel-mode clients can do either
    * use handles
    * work with objects directly

### WinObj

### objects
* structures instantiated and loaded in memory with some API
* windows is not object-oriented fully â€” does not support polymorphism directly, but is object-built system

| 1. object name         | just a string; not all objects are named                                            |
| 2. object directory    | logical placement within object manger's namespace                                  |
| 3. security descriptor | users and tokens that can access it and actions permitted (related to Win security) |
| 4. open handle count   | reference count - object is alive as long as it is referred to by handles           |
| 5. list of handles     | list of actual handles                                                              |
| 6. pointer count       | count of not handles, but of directly used pointers to the objecs                   |
| 7. object type         | pointing to the type of windows object itself                                       |

| 1. kernel object |         |

* the illustration of windows kernel objects types such as process or file
* objects expose particular methods to be used by user-mode processes

### handles
* when a process 
    * creates an object
    * opens an object

- [x]  it receives a **HANDLE** to the object
- [x]  **JUST A NUMBER** used as an opaque, indirect pointer to the underlying object
- [x] allows sharing object across processes via different handles
- [x] in .NET, used internally by types such as FileStream, Mutex, Semaphore, AutoResetEvent, etc.
* each process has a **PRIVATE HANDLE TABLE** 

### handles in procExp
* go to **VIEW** ðŸ Š **Show Unnamed Handles and Mappings** to access all handles in the lower pain

![handles_in_lower_pane]({{ site.url }}/assets/img000844.png)

* `CTRL-F` can be used to find a Handle or DLL substring
    * searches with currently used files, keys, dlls, etc.

* **TIP:** if a file cannot be deleted because it is used by a different file is to find the open handle to that file here
