## findings
* from windows server 2008 r2 there are only 64-bit version of windows server
* clients still have 32-bit and 64-bit

### 1. what is the problem with a 32-bit system
* only 2GB address space
* process can require some more
* the true way of handling this is 64-bit where each process as 8TB or more of address space

### 2. challenge for 64-bit: how to run old 32-bit processes?
* **WOW** means **Windows on Windows**
* **WOW64** means **Windows on Windows64**
* **WOW64** is **user-mode-ONLY**
    * in kernel, you need everything 64-bit on 64-bit system
* ðŸ Š win32 binaries are executed on windows64-bit seamlessly
* there is an **INTERCEPTION** going on
* the kernel is still **64-bit**
    * ... which really means calling **64-bit ntdll.dll**
* the benefit for running WOW64 is that the address space doubles from 2GB also 4GB

### 3. device drivers
* must be native 64-bit, as drivers are running in the kernel mode

### 4. file system: confusion ahead
* the following can be confusing as system directories names have not changed in 64 bit Windows
    * ðŸ Š there is redirection in place
    * any time a process tries to access `\system32` it accesses `\syswow64`
    * this is transparent to the application

STEP# | FILEPATH            | COMMENT
------|---------------------|-----------------------
1     | `\windows\system32` | contains 64-bit images
2     | `\windows\syswow64` | contains 32-bit images

* every 64-bit machine has those two

### 5. architecture 

![wow64_architecture]({{ site.url }}/assets/img000779.png)

### 6. restrictions
* 64-bit process **CANNOT LOAD** a 32-bit DLL and **VICE VERSA**
* ðŸ Š within the process, the bitness must remain the same
* exception: resource-only DLLs, which can be loaded cross-architecture
* some APIs are not supported by Wow64 processes

### 7. redirection
#### 7.1. file system redirection
* this happens automatically and you do not see `\syswow64` folder even in registry properties for `\wow64`
* system director 
* in filesystem, the `\system32` is mapped to `\syswow64`
* when installed
    * 32-bit apps are installed in `\Program Files (x86)`
    * 64-bit apps are installed in `\Program Files`
* some directories are not redirected

#### 7.2. registry redirection
* components trying to register as 32 bit and 64 bit will clash
* 32-bit components are redirected to `Wow64` registry node
* so, please realize that once you are running 64-bit process you just cannot run 32-bit DLLs
