title: SICP 01.04; conventional interfaces as second way of controlling complexity
categories: []
---

## usecase

The doc's aim is entering a second section of SICP, a 2nd approach to manage complexity called **conventional interface**

![conventional_interfaces]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002361.jpg)

### 1. example: linear combination
* you want to express a general idea

![linear_combination]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002374.jpg)

* this general idea of linear combination can be applied

### 2. problem in the relationship between general <-> applied methods
* the actual primitive operations that will go into the machines will be different if you
    * combine 2 electrical signals
    * combine 2 vectors
    * combine 2 polynomials
* you need the **knowledge of things** that
    1. **you can add**
    2. **ways of adding them**
* where ? where ? where is this knowledge ? 
* also, if you add another item, how to do that without disrupting existing procedures â€” this is the control of another type of complexity (complexity of change and maintenance)
* solution: **conventional interface** 
    * standard way of plugging things together
    * and this is the second part of SICP in general after black-box abstractions
