## usecase

### 1. steps/?
0. update the list or remote branches (and remove deleted ones), if needed

```
git remote update origin --prune
```

1. check out the remote branch

```
git checkout --track origin/<oldName>
```

2. Rename the checked-out branch:

```
git branch --move <new_name>
```

3. Push the `<new_name>` local branch and reset the upstream branch. Now you have 2 branches in remote. Both `<old_name>` and `<new_name>`

```
git push origin --set-upstream <new_name>
```

4. Delete the `<old_name>` remote branch. Note you don't use `git branch -D <name>` at all (default cmd to delete a branch locally). 

```
git push origin --delete <old_name>
```

* Now you have 1 renamed branch in remote ‚Üí Done
