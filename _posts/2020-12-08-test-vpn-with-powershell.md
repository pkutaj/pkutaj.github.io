## usecase
The concern is documenting my attempts to automatically authenticate to hashicorp stack with the start of the terminal â€” but sometimes I am out of VPN. The need is to check for VPN fast

### 1. find the VPN adapter 
* go to network and sharing center

>Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections

* rename the VPN adapter to `vpn`, see below

![vpn_adapter]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002337.png)

### 2. use the bracket notation to check for properties
* connected to the VPN is `up`
* disconnedted is `disconnected`, for example (the alias is already renamed adapter):

```
(Get-NetIPConfiguration -InterfaceAlias "vpn").NetAdapter.status
Disconnected
```
