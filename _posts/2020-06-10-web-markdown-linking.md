### video
### (1) use case
* I did not know this
* I knew markdown is designed for readibility, but considered the longed URIs as the necessary evils that had to be texts when I needed to pass a link to the resource
* I found out in a github-based wiki that that is actually not the case 

### (2) instructions
* get a link 
* paste a link to the bottom of the page

```
[markdown homepage]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown
```

* in the text, refer to that link with `[hypertext][hyperlink]` syntax
* in this case `[markdown homepage][MDhome]`
* so you can visit [markdown homepage][MDhome]
