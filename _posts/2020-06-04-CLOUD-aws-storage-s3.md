title: AWS > S3, buckets & hosting a static web
categories: [cloud]

## overview
The concern is to document the intro to the AWS S3 service, basically with a demo of a short static web site of a host using the service.

## findings
### (1) on buckets
* S3 = simple storage service
* the unit of file storage/organization is called a **BUCKET**

![bucket_as_s3_unit]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001083.png)

* each bucket has a **SET OF SETTINGS** 
* settings apply to that particular bucket 
* ‚úîÔ∏è enables URL access for files
* ‚úîÔ∏è offers configurable rules for data lifecycle
* ‚úîÔ∏è can serve as a static web host ‚Äî something I used to miss working with Google Drive

### (2) 4x storage classes
* **NOTE:** these all are **NON-ARCHIVAL CLASSES** (about archiving, later)

#### (2.1) standard
* default class for freqwuently accessed data

#### (2.2) intelligent-tiering
* moving your data to the correct class **BASED ON USAGE**
* moves between _frequent_ and _infrequent_ access
* performance **s3 intelligent tiering** = **s3 standard**

#### (2.3) standard-IA (infrequent access)
* get lower cost for utilizing this class
* standard resiliency because the data is accessible across multiple AZs

#### (2.4) one zone-IA (infrequent access)
* stored only in 1 AZ

### (3) on storing accross multiple AZ
- [x] durable data
- [x] accessible data

### (4) lifecycle policies
* criteria for a bucket enabling data to **transition**/**expire** 
* transition can move on another storage class based on **time**
    * not usage, that is possible only with intelligent tiering
* expiration can delete objects based on age
* policies can factor in version o specific objects in a backet

### (5) transfer acceleration
* optimized uploading of data using AWS edge locations
* enabled per bucket
* part of the **CLOUDFRONT**

### (6) DEMO: hosting a static website
#### (6.1) STEP-1 create a bucket 
1. create a bucket
    * select the option that you want to enable the option to make the file public
2. upload a file
3. go to permissions ü†ä make a file public
4. optional: enable encryption
5. open the public URL

#### (6.2) STEP-2 enable static website hosting
* go to bucket ü†ä properties ü†ä static website hosting

![enable_static_website_hosting]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001085.png)

![enable_static_website_hosting]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001086.png)

* go and set permissions on `index.html` file (you'll get 403 Forbidden HTTP status, i.e. access denied)
* create a random **hello world** `index.html` locally and upload it to the bucket
