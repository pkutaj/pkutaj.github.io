## the case	
what is the difference between array of arrays and array of objects ?

## findings
* advantage of objects is that you can use clear names to identify data
* array helps these objects to be put in order

* structure array as an ordered list of objects

* call 'records' within objects by the name of their property using the dot notation while calling a first array item with bracket [] notation
