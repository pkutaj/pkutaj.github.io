## usecase
The doc's aim is writing a procedure for finding a method for finding a square root according to Heron of Alexandria.

### 1. algorithmic definition for finding square root

![algorithm]({{ site.url }}/assets/img002429.jpg)

### 2. CODE 
* composed of 7 functions
* `_tryThis` is a [recursive one](#2-recursion)
* begins at the bottom with calling the initial guess `1` with `return _truncate(_tryThis(1))`

```python
def sqrt(x):
    def _average(x, y):
        return (x+y)/2

    def _square(x):
        return x*x

    def _abs(x):
        if x < 0:
            return -x
        elif x == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return x

    def _improve(guess):
        return _average(guess, (x/guess))

    def _goodEnough(guess):
        return _abs(_square(guess) - x) < 0.001

    def _tryThis(guess):
        if _goodEnough(guess):
            return guess
        else:
            return _tryThis(_improve(guess))

    def _truncate(n, decimals=3):
        multiplier = 10 ** decimals
        return int(n * multiplier) / multiplier

    return _truncate(_tryThis(1))
```

### 3. recursion
* this is a **recursive definition** that allows to go on until something is true
* note the independence of recursion hre: **you don't need any other looping construct**other than the ability to call the procedure

### 4. block structure
* structure where procedures contain other procedures within themselves
* it is a package of procedures hidden inside the `sqrt` box
* users should not care what is within the black box
