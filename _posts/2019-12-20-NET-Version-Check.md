### downgrade
* All versions of the .NET Framework 4 family are in-place upgrades
    * they **replace** previous versions of the .NET Framework 4 family instead of installing side-by-side.
* When installing redistributable versions you must **use the Programs and Features** control panel to uninstall the newer version âž” re-install the older version afterwards.
* However, some versions of Windows include a version of the .NET Framework 4 family as a part of the operating system. 
    * On those versions of Windows, newer versions of the .NET Framework 4 family will be **installed as OS update packages**, and they must be uninstalled using the Installed Updates control panel.
    * This can be tricky because the OS update packages do not include .NET Framework in the name
    * Need to know the KB number in order to find and uninstall newer versions of the .NET Framework 4 family
    * Or, if you know when you installed the newer version of the .NET Framework, you can sort the Installed Updates control panel by installed date and find it that way.
* Some of the download pages for the .NET Framework 4 family also include information about which exact KB number will be installed on which versions of Windows.
