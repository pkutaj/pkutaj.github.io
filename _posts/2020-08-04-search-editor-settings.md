## abstract
The concern is documenting the essential **lookup** flow when using vsc as a kb. 

## contents
<!-- TOC -->

- [1. persistent filter](#1-persistent-filter)
- [2. flow](#2-flow)

<!-- /TOC -->

### 1. persistent filter
* there is way too many files in my workspace
* all KBs are in the markdown format
* â†’ i need the persistent filter for `*.md` 
* this is not possible in search editor
* this is possible in search sidebar 

### 2. flow
1. highlight
2. lookup in sidebar with `ctrl-shift-f`
3. if needed, open in search editor with `alt+enter`
