title: History > Mozilla is Mosaic Godzilla (the killer of Mosaic browser)
---
## the case	
* I have overheard the phrase that Mozilla means as Mosaic Godzilla, i.e. Mosaic Killer. What is this Mosaic and why was it necessary to destroy?

## solution/status
* Mosaic was the first browser released in 1993, whose founders fled into the new project called Netscape.
* Mosaic was for the web what iphone was for the smartphone — the groundbreaking product bringing it into masses. The mother of Chrome. 
	* Before that, the networking foundations existed, but UI was just a cryptic text-interfaces. 
* guys from Mosaic left the organization under the auspices of which this project was created (NCSA in Illinois) and headed to California where they eventually started Netscape
* the Nescape story is fascinating in and of itself, it is a cultural blueprint for tech industry today with it's values and myths. 
	* See Chapter 1 of [The Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/podcasts-by-chapter/)
* From the technical standpoint, Netscape lost the first browser war (IE won if you wonder:) but that  led to the creation of web standards, i.e. neutral bodies and rules for making web work on any browser. 
* To the point, there was a split between Mosaic and Netscape and there was a need to kill the old Mosaic.
* A guy called Jaime Zawinski from the Netscape team came up with Mosaic godzilla which is mozilla - the Mosaic killer already before 1995
* Eventually, Netscape was open sourced and free and the foundation was created 
* In 1998 `mozilla.org` was registered and now you have mozilla firefox
		○ + netscape is free and open sourced
* mozilla browser was created after netscape dies
* firefox became a branch of the code-base, the light-weight branch in 2004
* the first logo was created by Shepard Fairey (remember 2008's Obama Hope poster? Same guy), as he worked in an agency doing work for Netscape at the time
