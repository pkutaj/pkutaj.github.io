## the case 
* the question is, what is the JSON format
* where is it used 
* how does it relate to SQL (is there any relevance) 
* how does it relate to object data structure 
* is object data structure unique for Javascript 

## notres 
* object data structure allows you to store data in key:value pair which is a very common form of information 
* objects are the model for one of the most popular data exchange formats on the web - **JSON** 
* JSON: Javascript Object Notation 
### Usage 
* commonly used in AJAX to exchange data between server and clients (web browsers) 
* mongoDB uses JSON to read and update from a database 
* commonly used in APIs to exchange data between servers themselves 
### Difference between object literal and JSON  
* JSON is just a string inside quote marks! 
* Browsers do well @ sending strings across networks (HTML is such a string) 
* JSON is a string formatted like a JS object 
* The reason is once the browser receives this string, it can be parsed into a pure JS object and you can use programming tools (not just JS) to work with it!
