the question is the acronym and syntax of SASS and SCSS, as I have been encountering this in styling Jekyll

## toc
<!-- TOC -->

- [SASS vs SCSS](#sass-vs-scss)
- [sources](#sources)

<!-- /TOC -->

## findings
* Dynamic Style Sheet language
* SASS = Syntactically Awesome StyleSheet
* compiles down to CSS like LESS
* Contains
    * variables
    * nesting
    * modules
    * mixins
    * inheritnce
    * operators

    * based on indention and nesting
    * did not feel like css âž” 2nd syntax created
