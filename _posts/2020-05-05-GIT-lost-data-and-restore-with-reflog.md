* mysteriously, I created a branch with the name identical to the SHA of a commit via VSCode UI ?

* note the reduced number of files after I switched the branch from **recovered** ðŸ Š **master**

### git reflog
* `reflog` stands for **REFERENCE LOGS**
* record when the **tips** of branches and other references were updated in the **LOCAL REPO**

### STEP-1 find the SHA of the commit at the TIP of your deleted branch
* the following command gives you HEADs of all the branches

```
git reflog
```

### STEP-2 restore the branch
* the name of the `<branch>` is **IRRELEVANT & CUSTOM**
* the `sha` is **CRUCIAL & FIXED** and it 
* ðŸ Š recreates the branch and all its content before it was deleted

```
git checkout -b <branch> <sha>
```

### explanation
#### HEAD
* reference variable that git keeps
* aim: it is a pointer, a reference to a **SPECIFIC COMMIT** in a repo
* this specific commit is **TIP** of the current branch
* this specific commit is **THE LAST STATE** of the current branc
* this specific commit is **THE PARENT OF THE NEXT COMMIT** 

#### Branches
* with a new branch, a new head is created
* when you do some changes and commit the changes, a new head is created
* and if you delete the test branch, **HEAD REFERENCE STILL PERSISTS** ðŸ Š thus you can recover the branch

##### Create a Branch

```
git checkout -B <branch>
```

##### Checkout a branch

```
git checkout <branch>
```
