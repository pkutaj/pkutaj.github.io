## usecase
The concern is documenting the control flow structure known as **with-block** that replaces the need to pair each `open()` with

<!-- /TOC -->

### 1. usual pattern
* the pattern of working with the files where you

```python
# 1. open a file
f = open(...)
# 2. work with the file
# ...
# 3. close a file
f.close()
```

* The close is important as it informs the operating system that the work with the file has been finished
* It closes the handle and releases the file for further use
* Also, it saves the changes - without closing, it is possible to lose data
    * there may be pending writes buffered up that may not get written completely
* Or, when opening lots of files, the system may run out of resources
* The mechanism that pairs `open()` with `close()` is similar to garbage collector mechanisms in languages without memory management

### 2. enter with-block
* any objects that supports he **context-manager protocol**  â€” file objects are one of them
* it exploits the context-protocol nature of the file object 
* it uses the with clause
* the aim is to get rid of the need to close the resource explicitly
* this is error-prone and even if it is not forgotten, one must use `try-catch-finallly` block to handle exceptions
* the with construct calls it for us

```
with EXP as VAR:
    BLOCK 
```

### 3. zen of python
* this also resonates with the first aphorism of the zen of python: _Beautiful is better than ugly_ which, here, is taking precedence over _Explicit is better than implicit_

### 4. comparative linguistics: this is similar to using in c-sharp
* the `with-block` has similar function as `using` in C#
