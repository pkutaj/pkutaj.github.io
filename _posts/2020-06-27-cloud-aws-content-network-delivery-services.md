## findings
### (1) definition
* virtual private cloud is a **logically isolated** section of the AWS where it is possible to launch resources in a virtual network that user defines
* ü†ä _Your slices of the cloud_ ü†à
* ‚úîÔ∏è enables virtual networks
* ‚úîÔ∏è supports IPv4
* ‚úîÔ∏è supports IPv6

### (2) 4x configuration
1. IP address range
2. route tables
3. subnets
4. gateways

### (3) subnetting: both private and public
* can utilize NAT for private subnets
* enables connection to a DC
* can connect to other VPCs
* can privately connect to other AWS services

### (4) AWS Direct Connect
* cloud service solution making it easy to establish a **DEDICATED NETWORK CONNECTION** from your DC to the AWS
* scenario: application data is in DC, the application is in AWS, the connection is direct, not sending data through the internet

### (5) Route 53
* one of the 2 services leveraging **EDGE LOCATION**
* ‚úîÔ∏è  global
* ‚úîÔ∏è  DNS
* any changes made applied globally
* ‚úîÔ∏è  HA (highly available)
* global resource routing 
* DNS changes are not instantaneous ‚Äî changes need to propagate
* For an elegant overview see [DNS in One Picture](https://roadmap.sh/guides/dns-in-one-picture)

### (6) elastic load balancing
* elasticity is the ability to grow and contract instantly as requested/based on usage
* navigating users to the correct infrastructure
* it distributes traffic across multiple targets
* integrates with 
    * ‚úîÔ∏è  ec2
    * ‚úîÔ∏è  ecs
    * ‚úîÔ∏è  lambda
* supports 1+ AZ's in a region
* 3 types
    * **ALB**; application load balancers
    * **NLB**; network load balancers
    * **ELB**; classic load balancers

### (7) scaling
* you can leverage **AUTOSCALING GROUP** + **LOAD BALANCERS** to make this work

#### (7.1) vertical; scale-up
* you **SCALE-UP** your **INSTANCE TYPE** to a larger instance type with **ADDITIONAL RESOURCES**
* an reboot is needed; discreet

#### (7.2) horizontal; scale-out
* you **SCALE-OUT** and **ADD ADDITIONAL INSTANCES** to handle the demand of an application
* continuous

### (8) cloudfront
* leveraging AWS **EDGE LOCATIONS**
* **CDN** ‚Äî content delivery network
    * enables users to get content from server closest to them
    * supports static and dynamic content
    * utilizes AWS edge locations
* ‚úîÔ∏è  advanced security features
    * AWS shield for DDos
    * AWS WAF
* the benefit that your content can be distributed globally within a matter of minutes

### (9) API gateway
* fully managed API management service
* web services that other apps can call
* integrates with multiple AWS services
* provides monitoring and metrics on API calls
* supports both VPC and on-prem private apps
