## the case	of undoing
* the question is how to undo the things in git
* currently, **3 RESETS AND 1 CHECKOUT**

## findings

### (1) RESET ➔ git reset HEAD: undo the stage

### (2) RESET ➔ git reset --soft HEAD~1: undo the commit, keep the stage

> scenario: I stage 50 small changes, commit them in bulk and push it to the jekyll pages. The build fails. I need to undo the commit and start analyzing where it went wrong. 

* you have staged many files
* you commit them at once from the **INDEX** into **HEAD**
* UNDO just the commit and put it all back to the index, you move the **HEAD** to the commit before
* this brings files back to INDEX
* this does not change any files themselves


### (3) RESET ➔ git reset --hard HEAD~1: undo the commit; undo the stage; keep files 

> scenario: I hit a wrong button in VSCode sometimes and I stage or even commit everything

* Then I need to undo that step in a terminal quickly
* run `git reset --hard HEAD^` 
* If multiple commits from the top, you can run git `reset --hard HEAD~2` to remove the last two commits. 
* You can increase the number to remove even more commits.

###  (4) CHECKOUT ➔ git checkout: undo local uncommitted file changes
* **DANGEROUS**

>scenario: working on something and you just don't want to create `.old`, i.e. you just want to be able to go to the last commit of that file

* Commit (i.e. **CHECK-IN**) version_1 that would like to use as a restore point

```
git add foo.bar && git commit -m foo-bar -RESTORE point
```

* this file in that state is commited and is waiting to be pushed
* start working and experimenting
* discarding local changes (permanently) to a file: `git checkout --<file>`

```
git checkout -- 2020-07-17.js
```

* the file will be **OVERWRITTEN**
* if I want to return to a particular version of the commit I combine the SHA with the filename

```
git checkout 55fc911 "2020-05-18.js"
```

* **NOTE:**  

>I've always been uncomfortable with this GIT CHECKOUT command because it's used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and unusual, destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).

### (5) REVERT
> scenario: you made a change, commited it, and pushed to remote (like test the change of a config file on github pages). You made a mistake. You realized immediatelly. How to undo now? 

* the obvious way is to undo in a new commit/push
* the less obvious, good for training, way you revet a commit, whic his **CREATING A NEW COMMIT UNDOING ALL CHANGES MADE IN THE BAD COMMIT**
* the following is for the forceful removal of the last commit both locally and in the remote branch

```
git reset HEAD^ --hard
git push origin master -f
```
