## usecase
The aim of this pageüìù is to show the use of `[-n "$foo"]` and `[-z "$foo"]` comparison operators in bash. I am learning how to read bash and I have encountered.

```bash
if [ -z "${env_json}" ]; then
```

Which executes only if `${env_json}` evaluates to an empty string. I am also adding pieces from Powershell (posh) and python (it's PEP8 style guide).

### 1. bash
* there is no built-in null variable
* there is a built-in `null` command, but that is a different story
* [Comparison Operators](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html#COMPARISON-OPS) 

```
-n
   string is not null.

-z
  string is null, that is, has zero length
```

* To illustrate with an AND logical operator (`&&`) where the statement executes only if both of the clauses evaluate to true

```bash
$ foo="bar";
$ [ -n "$foo" ] && echo "foo is not null" #true > echo executes
foo is not null
$ [ -z "$foo" ] && echo "foo is null"     #false > nothing
$ foo="";
$ [ -n "$foo" ] && echo "foo is not null" #false > nothing
$ [ -z "$foo" ] && echo "foo is null"     #true > echo executes
foo is null
```
 
### 2. posh and pep8
* empty string evaluates to `False` in a test
* but it is not `$null`

```powershell
if ($foo) {echo "hello there"}
if ($null -eq $foo) {echo "hello there"}
if (-not $foo) {echo "hello there"}
>>> hello there
```
 
* there are other methods in [posh](https://thinkpowershell.com/test-powershell-variable-for-null-empty-string-and-white-space/) but I would side with Python's PEP8 (Style Guide) that the above is the best way

> For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false
