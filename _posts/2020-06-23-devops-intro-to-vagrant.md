### 1. setting up dev env
* vagrant is here to remove the necessity of setting up development environments
* instead of pouring over documents and set up everything manually, you would
    1. clone a repo
    2. run `vagrant up` to get project up and running 

### 2. revive a project from 2 years ago
* vagrant is here to recreate the whole environment from the past
    * same OS as production
    * same config as productino
* ... without sacrificing the tools of your choice

### 3. container...
* you have a container that you spin up when you need it without poluting your own machine 
* you have a dev environment for the project
* now you have virtualization environments that abstracts pain
* it automatically installs all the software-per-project

### 4. commands
#### reload
* used after changes to `vagrantfile` have been done

#### ssh-config
* get your confid

```
Host support-tools
  HostName 172.18.101.179
  User vagrant
  Port 22
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  IdentityFile C:/Users/Admin/Documents/workspace/SNOW/support-tools/.vagrant/machines/support-tools/hyperv/private_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  LogLevel FATAL
  ForwardAgent yes
```

### 5.  you realize that you can connect to this from various angles
* ‚úîÔ∏è hyperv manager
* ‚úîÔ∏è mremoteNG
* ‚úîÔ∏è powershell itself
* I am running `Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS`

### 6.  mounting shares ? 
* [How to Mount a SMB Share in Ubuntu ‚Äì Zadara Storage Support](https://support.zadarastorage.com/hc/en-us/articles/213024986-How-to-Mount-a-SMB-Share-in-Ubuntu)

### found MS doc
* [Vagrant and Hyper-V -- Tips and Tricks | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20170706-vagrant-and-hyper-v-tips-and-tricks)
* Vagrant doesn't know how to set up networking on Hyper-V right now (unlike other providers), so it's up to you to get things working the way you like them. 
* Realize that Vagrant is using SMBv1 protocol that is by default disabled
* Check what with `Get-SmbServerConfiguration`

### provision
* provisioning means running a set of commands during the build of your environment
* this is set up in `.vagrantfile`
* use `config.vm.provision` method call. 

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other configuration

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo hello"
end
```
