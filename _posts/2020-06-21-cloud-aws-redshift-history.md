### 1. etymology
* from physics ü†ä when light or radiation has its **wavelength increased**
* but also (wikipedia) the name means to shift away from Oracle, which is known as "Big Red" for its corporate colors

### 2. DWH scales
* in the course of the few decades we got from gigabytes into petabyte-scale
* GB ü†ä TB ü†ä PB

### 3. scale-out arrives
* the arrival of new bigdata products scaling the processing of data
* ‚úîÔ∏è hadoop
* ‚úîÔ∏è couchbase

### 4. relational survives
* there was a period announcing the demise of the relational model
* this has not occurred
* massively parallel relational DB such as Teradata continued to offer relational scale-out architecture as **expensive appliances**

### 5. paraccel forks postgress
* ParAccel develops a fork of **Postgres 8.0.2** scaling out on commodity hardware
    * Postgres is open-source and popular
    * scale-out like hadoop but is relational
* this gets the attention of AWS in 2012
* AWS licenses ParAccel technologies and develops Redshift as an MPP (massive parallel processing) DW running on cloud architecture
* this is **heavily modified Postgres** ü†ä but not everything Postgres can do is possible in Redshift
