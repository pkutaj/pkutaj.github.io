## findings
### (1) empty inbox
> Immediately move obligations out of your inbox and into role-specific repositories.

* daily cleanup of inbox â€” which is a place for new (unfiltered) messages
* usually, there are **INBOX HOURS** 
    * when you start work (take-off)
    * when you end work (landing)
* empty the inbox by
    1. delete
    2. archive (mark as read ðŸ Š move to archive)
    3. decide and label the task 
        * K&R
        * DIP
    4. empty the inbox by moving it to the TODO folder

### (2) filter nonsense


### (3) inbox VS todo
* inbox and TODO are the only 2 folders
* delete all stuff from the inbox and move the rest to the TODO

### (4) k&r VS dip
* **K&R** as in kiss and ride, not as in kernighan and richie, for quick todos to be done before the dip
* **DIP** as in deep + difficult, from cal newport + seth godin to expect some pain in deep descent

### (5) act now
* from seth godin, do not postpone responses
* no kicking the can down the road

> Thereâ€™s a button on my email program that allows me to postpone an incoming email to a future day. Sort of like a snooze button. The snooze button is a trap. Itâ€™s a trap because not only do you have to decide later, but you just expended time and energy to deciding to decide later. Do it once, move on.

â€” Seth Godin

### (6) no mouse (gmail proper)

### (10) snooze-as-done
* my todo folder is for today
* as this is personal-level, I don't see the need of having the overview of all postponed / partially done things
* if I have daily k&r task (like a weekly small thing to kick off the day), I snooze it until tomorrow
* instead, you **MARK SNOOZED AS READ** and starting from the next day, you **MARK ALL AS UNREAD** to start the countdown again

### (11) notifications?
* currently experimenting with desktop notifications as a way to get attention to the tickets .
* don't rush no that
* don't get excited on that
