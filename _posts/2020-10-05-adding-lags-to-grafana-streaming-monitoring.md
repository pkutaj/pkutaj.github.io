## usecase
The concern is documenting monitoring Amazon Kinesis (streaming service) â€” notably so called "lags"; i.e. the amount of time a certain record is not consumed from the stream. The wildcard feature for cloudwatch allows an easy, but noisy panel,  I need to break that into per-stream panel for easier monitoring â€” there is 7 streams ðŸ ‹ for prod & qa environment for collector stream and then enrichment and bad data stream.

### 1. result

### 2. features
### 3. period dropdown
* must be in seconds

![period_in_seconds]({{ site.url }}/assets/{{ site.url }}/assets/img001952.png)

* setup in _Settings_ â†’ _Variables_ â†’ _New_ 

![new_dropdown_in_secs]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001953.png)

* seems not to work with other time unitss
* note the variable reference is case-sensitive

### 4. panel broken down into 3
* as I want lags per stream, need to use the cloudwatch search expressions


![custom_expression]({{ site.url }}/assets/img001950.png)

* Custom Search expression

```
SEARCH(' {AWS/Kinesis,StreamName} MetricName="GetRecords.IteratorAgeMilliseconds" collector', 'Maximum', $Period)
```

### 5. thresholds
