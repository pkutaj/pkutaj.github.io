### (1967) 
#### simula 67 & oop
```plaintext
Both imperative programming and functional programming have their roots in 
the mathematics of computation theory ➔➔➔ predating digital computers. 
As opposed, “Object-Oriented Programming” (OOP) was coined by Alan Kay circa 1966 or 1967 
while he was at grad school.
```
* The terminology stemming from the first OOP language, Simula 67 

#### hypervisor
* The first hypervisors providing full virtualisation are created on IBM mainframes on CP-40 system
* the hardware's supervisor state was virtualized, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts

### (1974) 
#### SQL
* originally **SEQUEL** — Standard English Query Language
* 1986 standardized

### (1975) 
#### microsoft founded
* Microsoft is founded and BASIC — the first computer language program for a PC — is developed

### (1980)
#### Objective-C, C++
- Objective-C > invented by Bred Cox, a smalltalk programmer. made a small preprocessor in front of C
- C++ > by Bjarne Stroustrup, a simula programmer. initially c with classes; renamed later
- objective-c is all the rage in the early 80s
-  1986 c++ author wrote a book rhat killed objective-c;  copied k and r. c++ programming language. framed it as the next C
- objective c is done, stepstone is leaving
- the revival comes with NEXT led by Steve Jobs after his expulsion from Apple. 
- after Jobs comes back to Apple he brings his whole team with him
- the rest is history

### (1990S) 
#### the hegemony of microsoft
* everyone is making strategic decision based on what MS was or was not doing

### (2000)
#### REST defined by Roy Fielding
### (2001) 
#### agile revolution   
### (2005-2006) 
#### the invasion of project managers into the Agile movement
### (2006) 
#### Solr
* YONIK SEELEY for CNET
* Contributed to Apache in Jan 2006
* Java Web App ➔ Serverlization of Lucene

### (2005) 
#### virtualization
* even though the concept of hypervisor goes back to the late 1960s, it's in the early 2000s that we see the resurgence of virtualization because of
    * expanding hardware capabilities, allowing each single machine to do more simultaneous work
    * efforts to control costs and to simplify management through consolidation of servers
    * the need to control large multiprocessor and cluster installations, for example in server farms and render farms
    * the improved security, reliability and device independence possible from hypervisor architectures
    * the ability to run complex, OS-dependent applications in different hardware or OS environments
