#### Beej's Guide to Network Programming

Socket Programming featured in David Beazley's famous live coding - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4 - so as I am new to network programming, I'm glad to have some intro here to better enjoy the talk, really (not doing any of that myself)

#### Trumpian policy as cultural policy - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/trumpian-policy-as-cultural-policy.html>
Another important take for me - on cultural change there already was one about "The vibes have changed" that came out before the election. This is an implementation of cultural change by "flooding the zone" by filling media with agenda, constant, without time taking for implementation. It's just an aggresive take on the existing discourse. Fascinating.

#### Fallthrough & Friends with Matthew Sanabria & Kris Brandow (Changelog & Friends #77)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/77>
On documentation: what's often missing is I think my biggest gripe right now is just how few docs we have, how little documentation so many things have. But if there was a way… I think there was especially – what was it? There was one that was like the discover and learn steps. I am very frustrated often at libraries that I want to go in and understand, and there’s no “Oh, start looking here.” Or like “Here’s the basic architecture that you can then use to understand how this codebase is laid out, so you can go read the code and understand how we’ve implemented all of these things.” That documentation is almost always completely missing.

#### QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer: Visual tool to explore SQLite databases page-by-page, the way they're stored on disk and the way SQLite sees them.
* <https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer>
SQLite (and most databases) store data in disk-block-sized pages, usually 4KB, which helps make reads and writes as fast as possible.

Normally developers interact with databases on the "schema level" - tables, rows, and SQL. But taking a peek at the "page level" can give you some interesting insights:

#### PBS - JOHN GARDNER - EDUCATION AND EXCELLENCE
* <https://www.pbs.org/johngardner/sections/writings_speech_1.html>
The things you learn in maturity aren't simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You leant not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions, if you have any, which you do. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent, but pays off on character.

You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you, they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.

#### Discovering discovery coding with Jimmy Miller (Changelog & Friends #80)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/80#transcript>
But I think the key to get into discovery coding is to be willing to not have a solution in mind. I do think that that is easier said than done. I think it’s very, very tempting anytime you’re approaching programming problems to come with solutions. And I don’t know, it sounds almost silly when I say it, but I’ve found that to be the number one thing that stops me from finding the good solutions, is that I already have a solution in mind, even if it’s just in the back of my head, and as I’m going and doing this, I will just automatically go towards that solution.

So step one, clear your mind, meditate… No solutions. Step two I really think is ask questions. Ask questions about the codebase, about the problem, about whatever it is that is this situation you’re in, and try to find the answers for those. And if the answers are frustrating to find, if it just takes too long to find them, build a tool that makes it really easy. And if you start there, the process of discovery coding will start becoming the easy default, because every time you want to have an answer, you already have tools available to you to help find that answer, and that ends up being like your inspiration for how to continue.

So the goal is to try to make it easy to discovery-code, because if it’s not, you’re never gonna do it. So you kind of have to do the hard work up front.

#### Programming with LLMs featuring David Crawshaw (Changelog Interviews #629)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/629>
A different take on AI assisted coding than one you have from Primagean, who is much more skeptical. This is more specific, building Go-specific tooling and being passionate about what LLMs can do for us. Also appreciating how code-completion is a completely different paradigm than a chat-bot for AI and how cool that is, pionereed by GitHub Copilot. I am not turning it back on, I don't depend on the amount of code I write for my paycheck so I rather write by myself, working through the problems alone. Or with occational oblique strategy. Still, it is fascinating what is happening, utterly mezmerizing to watch that.

#### New Junior Developers Can’t Actually Code

Clickbait and Moral Panic or it is really different? I am surely cautious. But the great plus is you CAN build things that until now needed code. If your focus is on craft - no. If your focus is on value - absolutely.

#### The return of the modern data stack - by Benn Stancil

So much fun! Which, sure, this is how databases work now. About ten years ago, they got split in half, into a bucket of data on one side, and a compute engine that runs calculations on the other. So long as the buckets are formatted correctly, you can mix and match different buckets with different calculators.

But this SAP product, if it works the way I think it does, extends that idea in a couple of new ways. First, it suggests that applications, like CRMs and ERPs to CPQs and ATSs, could be one of the buckets that databases connect their calculators to. Rather than exporting data out of SAP—which is how people have done this for a while, and it clearly hasn’t gone well—SAP can simply reformat it. Then, people can bring their database—or, since it’s 2025, bring their aGeNtS—directly to the applications themselves.

#### The End of Programming as We Know It – O’Reilly

as read and commented on by primagean - [(4) The End Of Programming As We Know It - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C79mALqHI0o&t=1015s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime) and I currently agree that one should invest into not be made stupid and one should be defending ones skills - if you've already aqcuired them. Is it good for lifetime?
