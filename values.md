### S === 'SLOW'
Nowadays it is not only my habit, it is also to my taste—a malicious taste, perhaps?—no longer to write anything which does not reduce to despair every sort of man who is “in a hurry.” ... in the midst of an age of “work,” of indecent and perspiring haste, which wants to “get everything done” at once: this art does not so easily get anything done, it teaches to read well, that is to say, to read slowly, deeply, looking cautiously before and aft, with reservations, with doors left open, with delicate eyes and fingers . . .

### B === 'BORING'
To be boring is to choose obvious over clever every time. To chase the right idea over your idea every time.  It is to be practical, to know that time and resources are extremely limited — so it means to maximize the process, work for the team and the timeframe. To be boring is to love consistency. To be boring is to love style guide.

### L === 'LAZY'
Lazy, most of the time, as to not leave a trace of yourself. Lazy means to pick and choose the right moments to always use or update existing laziness-promoting tools, but also to be open to being persuaded not to do so. If no laziness-promoting tools exist,  build the laziness promoting tools and go back to being —  boring.

### H === 'HISTORICAL'
To be sure, we need history. But we need it in a manner different from the way in which the spoilt idler in the garden of knowledge uses it, no matter how elegantly he may look down on our coarse and graceless needs and distresses. That is, we need it for life and action, not for a comfortable turning away from life and action or merely for glossing over the egotistical life and the cowardly bad act. We wish to use history only insofar as it serves living.
