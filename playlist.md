### 1. JAN 2023

#### 1.1. GitHub Copilot preliminary experience report
* <https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/12/05/github-copilot-preliminary-experience-report/>
* Notes on Experience with Github Pilot, similar to that of mine - it has the potential to surprise you, which is great. 
> I was, frankly, stunned. While I do understand that Copilot doesn't actually understand the code it suggests, Hedgehog is sufficiently esoteric that I didn't expect Copilot to have enough training data to enable it to make a useful contribution in this niche. I was wrong. I've repeatedly seen Copilot make suggestions to my F# and Haskell code. It's not just for C#, JavaScript, or python code.

#### 1.2. Free YouTube Transcripts
* <https://ytscribe.com/>
* For cases a transcription's required

#### 1.3. imaginAIry/README.md at master · brycedrennan/imaginAIry
* <https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry/blob/master/README.md>
* wow
 

#### 1.4. Overconfidence and AI 
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/overconfidence-and-ai/>
* My friend told me "AI is bullshitting a lot" which Seth Godin kindly frames as overconfidence
> Human beings are often more effective when we’re a bit self-effacing. “I think,” “Perhaps,” or “I might be missing something, but…” are fine ways to give our assertions a chance to be considered.

#### 1.5. Fighting Distraction With Unit Tests 
* <https://matthewc.dev/musings/unit-tests/>
* A hemmingway-style approach to writing code where you stop at writing the failing unit test as a sort of cliffhanger. 
> n/a

#### 1.6. ChatGPT Is Only Going to Get Better, and We Better Get Used to It - Bloomberg
* <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-23/chatgpt-is-only-going-to-get-better-and-we-better-get-used-to-it?utm_content=view&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&sref=htOHjx5Y>
* AI is developing in leaps - mind you.
> I ’ve started dividing the people I know into three camps: those who are not yet aware of LLMs; those who complain about their current LLMs; and those who have some inkling of the startling future before us. The intriguing thing about LLMs is that they do not follow smooth, continuous rules of development. Rather they are like a larva due to sprout into a butterfly. It is only human, if I may use that word, to be anxious about this future. But we should also be ready for it.

#### 1.7. Key Metrics for Monitoring AWS Fargate 
* <https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/aws-fargate-metrics/>
* How to Monitor ECS Fargate
> 

#### 1.8. Amazon ECS container logs for EC2 and Fargate launch types - AWS Prescriptive Guidance
* <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/ec2-fargate-logs.html>
* ECS does not have replicas or pods but it talks about tasks
> 

#### 1.9. How to Profile Your Code in Python 
* <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-profile-your-code-in-python-e70c834fad89>
* I am wondering why function that I expect to take shorter is taking longer for leetcode puzzles
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

#### 1.10. ChatGPT's killer enterprise use case will be managing knowledge, says EY CTO 
* <https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpts-killer-enterprise-use-case-will-be-managing-knowledge-says-ey-cto/>
* Knowledge keeping, managing and providing seems to be a killer feature for Enterprise AI
> 

#### 1.11. The coming ubiquity - Seth's Blog
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-coming-ubiquity/>
* On the invisible revolution of making AI everywhere allthetime
> But the real impact of AI isn’t going to be that it regularly and consistently does far better than the best human effort. The impact will be that it is widespread, cheap and always there.

#### 1.12. SQL should be your default choice for data engineering pipelines
* <https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_sql/>
* After a wave of noSQL tools, this is what you get in the beginning of 2023
> SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It’s robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it’s clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.

#### 1.13. dylanjcastillo/shell-genie: Your wishes are my commands
* <https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie>
* Another cool project to get info on AI
> Shell Genie is a command-line tool that lets you interact with the terminal in plain English. You ask the genie what you want to do and it will give you the command you need.

#### 1.14. Natural language is the lazy user interface - Austin Z. Henley
* <https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html>
* A slight critique of chatgpt as an interface as it lacking a big advangates of adaptable GUI.
> People are anticipating that large language models are going to revolutionize the world. And maybe they will. But a chat bot won't.

#### 1.15. On Email and Horses - Study Hacks - Cal Newport
* <https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2023/01/25/on-email-and-horses/>
* Cal Newport's ideas about smartphones being dangerous for anyone under 15 are shocking
>  An iPhone is clearly a superior device to a Motorola Razr, but does this mean 12-year-olds should be using them?

#### 1.16. The inside story of ChatGPT: How OpenAI founder Sam Altman built the world’s hottest technology with billions from Microsoft 
* <https://archive.ph/2023.01.25-131857/https://fortune.com/longform/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft/>
* History of OpenAI

#### 1.17. Oleksiy Danilov interview: 
* <https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2023/01/oleksiy-danilov-interview-weak-people-germany-russia-ukraine>
* n/a
> The West has an old problem: that is fear. The West has always been afraid of the Soviet Union. It believed the USSR was big and powerful and could solve everything quickly through military means. No conclusions were made even after the USSR invaded Afghanistan in 1979. And they couldn’t do anything there against the uneducated, at that moment, the mujahideen. That is when a conclusion should have been made that the USSR is not that powerful.But those conclusions were not made. And the West kept on being afraid.

#### 1.18. Five Days in Class with ChatGPT – The Alperovitch Institute
* <https://alperovitch.sais.jhu.edu/five-days-in-class-with-chatgpt/>
* And I say this as somebody who had been a hardened skeptic of the artificial intelligence hype for many years. Note that I didn’t say likely transform. It will transform higher education. Here’s why. The first use-case is that the machine “filters mundane questions,” as one of our students put it quite eloquently. Meaning: you can ask the dumb questions to the AI, instead of in-class. Yes, there are dumb questions—or at least there are questions where the answer is completely obvious to anybody who knows even just a little bit about, say, malware analysis (or has done their assigned readings).
> n/a

#### 1.19. Get/Want/Have To 
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/get-want-have-to/>
* A poetic approach to a mindset - for a thief of moments for passionate endevours, like reading a book for 5 minutes.
> The magic trick begins with realizing that the get to tasks are priceless want to moments if we choose. And, if we’re careful and plan ahead, we can get to the point where the have to agenda is something we can eagerly look forward to.

#### 1.20. Alex Epstein's *Fossil Future* - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/01/alex-epsteins-fossil-future.html>
* Remember Macaes: Most dangerous political movement in the West today is not populism, post fascism, wokeism… It’s a reflexive contrarianism that affirms the opposite of every sensible opinion. Silicon Valley actually played a role in this. Idolatry of disruption but now out of its element.
> My overall view is this: it is a good rebuttal to “the unrealistic ones,” who don’t see the benefits of fossil fuels.  But it does not rebut a properly steelmanned case for a transition away from fossil fuels.I view the steelmanned case as this: we cannot simply keep on producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions for centuries on end.  We thus need some trajectory where — at a pace we can debate — carbon emissions end up declining.  I’ve stressed on MR many times that climate change is not in fact an existential risk, but it could be a civilization-destroying risk if we just keep on boosting carbon emissions without end.  I don’t know a serious scientist who takes issue with that claim.

#### 1.21. Yiren Lu on Twitter: I’ve been playing around with GPT for various use cases. Here are some low-hanging ones I haven’t heard people mention
* <https://twitter.com/YirenLu/status/1620171019788120066>
* Continuing the discovery of usecases and cultivating the general awareness for the arrival the beast.
> At my agency, a great deal of operational work involves simply taking information from email conversations and inputting them in structured ways into a spreadsheet or web app. This is quite tedious to do, and is prone to errors/missing data. But ChatGPT is pretty good at this!

#### 1.22. javascript - Timestamp of when request was submitted from client - Stack Overflow
* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22996416/timestamp-of-when-request-was-submitted-from-client>
* Wrapping my head around network latencies
> You do realize that you cannot trust the client for anything? And that noone knows when the client's request was initiated except the client? – JonApr 10, 2014 at 18:47

### 2. FEB 2023
#### 2.1. Weaponizing hyperfocus: Becoming the first DevRel at Tailscale
* <https://tailscale.dev/blog/weaponizing-hyperfocus>
* A case study of the new concept - devrel
> In Spring 2022, I sat down and started to take DevRel seriously at Tailscale. I had heard about the practice in the past, but I had never done it before. I knew that a lot of it was talking about a product to people and finding new and interesting ways to use it, but a lot of that seemed too vague to really have any solid place to start from. It's like walking into an empty room and having no idea where to start decorating.At some level though, it felt right for me in a way that I have difficulty describing. It's the same feeling of it being right that I get from working in software in the first place. It felt like the type of rabbit-hole you could spend an entire career in

#### 2.2. Launch HN: Needl (YC S22) – Simple search across all your apps 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34598406>
* Cool project, I've been looking for this for a long time - but simply not enough. I need to search across at least ZD HC and Github Repos.
> To give generated answers to questions, we take the first results on Needl and run them through GPT-3 and use an engineered version of the user’s query to prompt GPT-3 accordingly. It’s similar to what Phind.com (Hello Cognition) and Perplexity.ai do with web search.

#### 2.3. Ask HN: Suggestions for working effectively with junior devs?

> The devs on my team are smart but mostly naive about getting stuff done in the real world. I'm sure they'll figure it out over time. But in the meantime, my days are quite frustrating because I'm in teaching mode most of the time instead of building stuff.Unfortunately you will either need to change your attitude or change teams. In your position, the expectation is that you are mostly a working through others and acting as a force multiplier of their work....And in general, there are two ways to go. The first is to accept the fact that many senior engineering and most staff engineering gigs are more about this kind of mentorship approach than actually doing work. And basically accept that the prime "getting shit done" years of your career are done and you will mostly be working in this new way now.The second is to change jobs where you are back in the driver seat. As a senior engineer, these positions DO exist even at FAANG (over on my team, I am the most junior with 12 years of experience). However, the more senior you get, the harder it is to find a role like this, especially in big tech - its the rare exception. Startups and consulting gigs probably better align with wanting to be hands on keyboard, but at the price of a paycut.

> underestimate the amount of work needed to make improvements. We've been a year away from full self driving cars for the last six years, and it seems like people are getting more cautious in their timing around that instead of getting more optimistic. Robotic manufacturing- driven by AI- was supposedly going to supplant human labor and speed up manufacturing in all segments from product creation to warehousing, but Amazon warehouses are still full of people and not robots.What I've seen again and again from people in the field is a gross underestimation of the long tail on these problems. They see the rapid results on the easier end and think it will translate to continued process, but the reality is that every order of magnitude improvement takes the same amount of effort or more.On top of that there is a massive amount of subsidies that go into training these models. Companies are throwing millions of dollars into training individual models. The cost here seems to be going up, not down, as these improvements are made.I also think, to be honest, that machine learning researchers tend to simplify problems more than is reasonable. This conversation started with "highly scalable system from scratch, or an ultra-low latency trading system that beats the competition" and turned into "the parsing of and generation of this kind of code"- which is in many ways a much simpler problem than what op proposed. I've seen this in radiology, robotics, and self driving as well.Kind of a tangent, but one of the things I do love about the ML industry is the companies who recognize what I mentioned above and work around it. The companies that are going to do the best, in my extremely bias opinion, are the ones that use AI to augment experts rather than try to replace them. A lot of the coding AI companies are doing this, there are AI driving companies that focus on safety features rather than driver replacement, and a company I used to work for (Rad AI) took that philosophy to Radiology. Keeping experts in the loop means that the long tail isn't as important and you can stop before perfection, while replacing experts altogether is going to have a much higher bar and cost.

> A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated.The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined.If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.

> The Copernican MomentSo what’s being stripped away here? And how?The what is easy. It’s personhood.By personhood I mean what it takes in an entity to get another person treat it unironically as a human, and feel treated as a human in turn. In shorthand, personhood is the capacity to see and be seen.This is obviously a circular definition, but that’s not a problem so long as we have at least one reference entity that we all agree has personhood. Almost any random human, like me or you (I’m not entirely sure about a few, but most people qualify), will do. So long as we have one “real person” in the universe, and agree to elevate any entity they treat unironically as a person as also a person, in principle, we can tag all the persons in the universe.In Martin Buber’s terminology (ht Dorian Taylor for suggesting this way of looking at it), X is a person if another person relates to it in an I-you way rather than an I-it way.

> The typical course on programming teaches a “tinker until it works” approach. When it works, students exclaim “It works!” and move on. Sadly, this phrase is also the shortest lie in computing, and it has cost many people many hours of their lives. In contrast, this book focuses on habits of good programming, addressing both professional and vocational programmers.By “good programming,” we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum.

For example, when dividing 20 (the dividend) by 3 (the divisor), the quotient is "6 with a remainder of 2" in the Euclidean division sense, and 623

* <https://peps.python.org/pep-0435/>
* Python has an ENUM type which was not known to me until studying <https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data>
> The properties of an enumeration are useful for defining an immutable, related set of constant values that may or may not have a semantic meaning. Classic examples are days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) and school assessment grades (‘A’ through ‘D’, and ‘F’). Other examples include error status values and states within a defined process.It is possible to simply define a sequence of values of some other basic type, such as int or str, to represent discrete arbitrary values. However, an enumeration ensures that such values are distinct from any others including, importantly, values within other enumerations, and that operations without meaning (“Wednesday times two”) are not defined for these values. It also provides a convenient printable representation of enum values without requiring tedious repetition while defining them (i.e. no GREEN = 'green').

The school’s decision was “rooted in the belief that students are dynamic, multi-faceted individuals who cannot be defined by any single factor,” the college said in a defense of its policy change.The SAT has faced heavy scrutiny for privileging rich families, which can pay for test-prep classes for their kids. Some believe that dropping the test is an ethical move toward equality in selective college admissions. Others argue that Columbia is replacing one metric skewed toward rich students with a bundle of metrics that are even more stratified by socioeconomic status, such as high GPAs, internships in Nicaragua, and expensive traveling soccer teams.

> ChatGPT is a bullshit artist with no real understanding of what it's writing about, but so are an awful lot of white-collar workers. It reliably emulates the shibboleths that indicate membership of the professional middle class. It isn't particularly creative or interesting, but it wasn't trained to do that - it was trained to produce maximally safe, inoffensive output. If people don't see ChatGPT as being massively disruptive, then I think they have failed to recognise the sheer proportion of working hours that are spent writing quite mundane letters and reports. Anyone who spends most of their working day in Outlook and Word should be extremely nervous about the medium-term implications of LLM

Note that **monkey patching a function call does not count as actually testing that function call!** **You ARE NOT actually using the function that you’ve monkey patched; you are rejecting its default behavior and subsituting it with new behavior.**

* The good old "If you want attention, start a fight" seems to suit here, I am afraid. Tyler's takes on books are just amazing. 
> That is the new book by Nigel Biggar, and it has already created a storm of controversy because of his claims that the British empire is, in my words, “underrated.”Let me first say that I am in no way upset at this thesis being put explicitly on the table.  And the book has many valuable discussions, covering issues such as how hard (at some point) the British worked to ban slavery, what were their motives for empire, what kinds of pressures for assimilation were asserted, and much more.My disappointment is how little space is devoted to the topic of sustainable economic growth.  In which parts of the empire did British rule boost sustainable economic growth, relative to a counterfactual of peaceful interaction but no conquest?  Singapore and Hong Kong seem obviously much richer and better off due to earlier British rule.  Malaysia likely as well, though the magnitude of the gain there is smaller.  But Sierra Leone not?  The country is miserably poor and has had numerous years of civil war, with a legacy of slavery as well.  Who could object to trying another run of history there, removing the British imperial role?  It is hard to see that it could get very much worse.  But then where does one put Kenya?

When I asked him if the war would end with a military victory or diplomacy, his first instinct was to reply, “Russian defeat”, but he quickly reverted back to diplomat in chief.

> Conditioning on completing the task, the average completion time from the treated group is 71.17 minutes and 160.89 minutes for the control group. This represents a 55.8% reduction in completion time. The p-value for the t-test is 0.0017, and a 95% confidence interval for the improvement is between [21%, 89%]. There are four outliers with time to completion above 300 min. All outliers are in the control group, however our results remain robust if these outliers are dropped. This result suggests that Copilot increases average productivity significantly in our experiment population. We also find that the treated group’s success rate is 7 percentage points higher than the control group, but the estimate is not statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.11, 0.25].

* Podcast with the head of OpenAI, but the most memorable is Kara's view on risk and a generational take. Altman is another young optimist, similar to what we have seen with the coming of the internet in the 90s, and there were many downsides (weaponization) that they were not treating properly. Not that Altman does not say - we wanted this to be a government project and it failed or that he is not 'building in public' to make everyone every (and others join) or that he is pro-regulatory. His view of humanity as one big technical revolution should be mitigated by reading some of Timothy Snyder's books.

#### How will AI transform childhood? - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/how-will-ai-transform-childhood.html>
* There is a general idea that digital technogy gets us information and makes us stupid, or at least intellectually weaker. I am a strong believer of a modular approach; the "devices" should be first and foremost "removables" before they become anything else and we should be able to peacefully walk and contemplate life without any need to get satisfaction via "digital assistant". Of course, also this idea has stupid at the edge (how autonomy do want, there are people living a happy life absolutely disconnected, but does that scale?). In any case, sure, AI for kids, but not if that makes him a stupid addict. 
> Many parents may be reluctant to let their kids become attached to an AI. But I predict that most families will welcome it. For one, parents will be able to turn off the connection whenever they wish. Simply clicking a button is easier than yanking an iPad out of a kid’s grasp.Most of all, letting your kid have an AI companion will bring big advantages. Your child will learn to read and write much faster and better, and will do better in school. Or maybe you want your kid to master Spanish or Chinese, but you can’t afford an expensive tutor who comes only twice a week. Do you want your child to learn how to read music? The AI services will be as limited or as expansive as you want them to be.It is an open question how quickly schools will embrace these new methods of learning. At some point, however, they will become part of the curriculum. Competitive pressures will make parents reluctant to withhold AI from their kids. Even if the AIs are not present in the classroom, some kids will use them to help do their homework, gaining a big advantage, and the practice will likely spread.Of course children will use these AIs for purposes far beyond what their parents intend. They will become playthings, companions, entertainers and much more. When I was a kid, with no internet and mediocre TV, I created imaginary worlds in the dirt, or with simple household items, and my parents often had no clue. The AI services will become part of this model of spontaneous play, even if parents try to make them purely educational.What about teenagers? Well, many parents may allow their kids to speak with AI therapists. It might be better than nothing, and perhaps better than many human therapists.

> Now for the fifth argument. It has to do with the influence of the tool we are trying to use upon our own thinking habits. I observe a cultural tradition, which in all probability has its roots in the Renaissance, to ignore this influence, to regard the human mind as the supreme and autonomous master of its artefacts. But if I start to analyse the thinking habits of myself and of my fellow human beings, I come, whether I like it or not, to a completely different conclusion, viz. that the tools we are trying to use and the language or notation we are using to express or record our thoughts, are the major factors determining what we can think or express at all! The analysis of the influence that programming languages have on the thinking habits of its users, and the recognition that, by now, brainpower is by far our scarcest resource, they together give us a new collection of yardsticks for comparing the relative merits of various programming languages. The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly

> The Microsoft Copilot "future of work" demo is incredible. Your boss will soon be able to ask their Copilot to create a summary of who does the least work on average and have their termination letter already drafted in Outlook.This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Managers often have to make subjective evaluations of workers with imperfect information. Soon, you can instead just ask Co-pilot to analyze the meeting transcripts in the knowledge graph and rank who make the most insightful contributions.From the reply: ust the world we wanted.

#### Pinker on Alignment and Intelligence as a Magical Potion
* <https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/pinker-on-alignment-and-intelligence>
* A quite interesting, including a noteworth constructivist/sociological take on the concept of IQ
> While I defend the existence and utility of IQ and its principal component, general intelligence or g,  in the study of individual differences, I think it’s completely irrelevant to AI, AI scaling, and [existential risk from AI]. It’s a measure of differences among humans within the restricted range they occupy, developed more than a century ago. It’s a statistical construct with no theoretical foundation, and it has tenuous connections to any mechanistic understanding of cognition other than as an omnibus measure of processing efficiency (speed of neural transmission, amount of neural tissue, and so on). It exists as a coherent variable only because performance scores on subtests like vocabulary, digit string memorization, and factual knowledge intercorrelate, yielding a statistical principal component, probably a global measure of neural fitness.In that regard, it’s like a Consumer Reports global rating of cars, or overall score in the pentathlon. It would not be surprising that a car with a more powerful engine also had a better suspension and sound system, or that better swimmers are also, on average, better fencers and shooters. But this tells us precisely nothing about how engines or human bodies work. And imagining an extrapolation to a supervehicle or a superathlete is an exercise in fantasy but not a means to develop new technologies.

That’s a slightly different process, involving multiple re-reads and building up a knowledge from very basic questions about the concepts.

#### State diagram - Wikipedia

* Learning about Circles and Arrows as Shannon's way to think visualizing computation already in 1949; learning about state machines and state diagrams. 
> State diagrams can be used to graphically represent finite-state machines (also called finite automata). This was introduced by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver in their 1949 book The Mathematical Theory of Communication. Another source is Taylor Booth in his 1967 book Sequential Machines and Automata Theory. Another possible representation is the state-transition table.
