### JAN 2022
#### Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy
* [Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy - UnHerd](https://unherd.com/2021/12/ernst-junger-our-prophet-of-anarchy/)
* Jünger despised Celine because of the lack of the skin in the game
> A fêted intellectual, and a lifelong francophile, he befriended the city’s cultural elite, socialising with Cocteau and Picasso as well as the collaborationist French leadership and literary figures such as the anti-semitic novelist Céline, a monster who “spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews — astonishment that anyone who had a bayonet was not making unrestrained use of it”. For Jünger, Céline represented the very worst type of radical intellectual: “People with such natures could be recognised earlier, in eras when faith could still be tested. Nowadays they hide under the cloak of ideas.

#### Steve Yegge, practicing programming
* [steve yegge - practicing-programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)
* an interesting comparison from brought from the (classical) music, but also reminiscent of the importance of [code katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) but also of the (absence of) historical consciousness. Imagine a crazy old excentric engineer doing something along the lines of Riccardo Muti (he is referring to events > half a century ago and considers them essential)

> Riccardo Muti initially insulted and shouted at his successor Riccardo Chailly, who had given up his own private room to the distinguished guest. After the concert, he called for a microphone to address the audience and was ignored by stage staff. He proceeded to shout half-comprehensible and generally **irrelevant comments about Toscanini’s return to La Scala in 1946**.

#### Ben Thomson, The Relentless Jeff Bezos
* [The Relentless Jeff Bezos – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/)
* Re-reading the second most read Stratechery piece of 2020
* Combining with one of my 2020s favorite piece [Culture matters](https://danluu.com/culture/) confirming that when it comes to culture, the [fish stinks from the head down](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/fish-rot-from-the-head-down.html) not only in negative, but also in positive ways (it is emblematic that relentless.com redirects to amazon.com)

#### Bill Gates Gets the Internet
* [Ch 2 Part 2 - Bill Gates "Gets" The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnmrSvU9_ug)
* From the great [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/), showing high adaptability of Bill Gates / Microsoft at the time

#### On the value of in-house expertise
* [Luu, Dan. The value of in-house expertise](https://danluu.com/in-house/)
* An argument for build in the build VS buy debate, claiming that in large-scale orgs there are highly specialized teams that are not directly related to a "core business", that actually function as profit centers (Twitter's kernel team). Always fun when Dan brings interdisciplinary examples, making his footnotes worth to pay attention to.

#### What America’s largest technology firms are investing in
* [What America’s largest technology firms are investing in - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/01/22/what-americas-largest-technology-firms-are-investing-in)
> When the twin foundations of the computer age, the transistor and Claude Shannon’s theory of information, came out of Bell Labs in the mid-20th century, it was not because the labs’ owner, at&t, was facing lots of scrappy competitors. It was because it wanted to make and own the future. Rob Atkinson, head of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank, argues something similar is true today: the Big Five are “oligopolists which use their market power to win the next big thing.”
* Combine with the foundational [The End of the Beginning – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/)

#### Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot
* [Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot - Artur Piszek](https://piszek.com/2022/01/24/stop-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot/)
* Reminds be of a strategy outlined in [The Education of a Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/495065.The_Education_of_a_Speculator) - for playing squash if I remember correctly, where the winner not the one that makes the kill, but the one that makes the least number of [unforced errors](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unforced_error)

#### The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make
* [The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make](https://www.thezbook.com/the-biggest-mistake-i-see-engineers-make/)
* Common at Support Engineering level as well, complement with the [item 7 of Uncle Bob's Craftman's Oath](https://youtu.be/17vTLSkXTOo?t=2608):

> I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me and that I can cover for them.

### FEB 2022
#### Extreme Programming 20 years later by Kent Beck
* [Extreme Programming 20 years later by Kent Beck - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGuTmOUdFbo)
* One of my favorite talks, the often black humor and an interesting facebook "patriotism" of the 2015 are noteworthy
* Also summarized my blog post [The History Of Extreme Programming, Feb, 2022](https://pavolkutaj.medium.com/the-history-of-extreme-programming-dcf6e234cb54)

#### Digital Advertising in 2022
* [Digital Advertising in 2022](https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/)
* In a dialectical conversation with past self from 6 years ago. Adding Amazon to Google and Facebook masters of digital advertising, making it a triumvirate. Witnessing this conversation from one own's thinking of the past is another reason why longevity matters so much and as Malcolm Gladwell puts is

> longevity, I have come to believe, is the most important and most often underestimated indicator of genius

— [Why Paul Simon? - Meta Bulletin](https://malcolmgladwell.bulletin.com/212667970940416/)

#### Cocktail party ideas
* [Cocktail party ideas - Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/)
* Another contrarian piece. Dan seems to understand the old marketing adage that saying something like _if you want an audience start a fight_:
> To validate someone's great idea see if they understand what subproblems need solution for the problem.

#### Stewart Brand on Starting Things and Staying Curious
* [Stewart Brand on Starting Things and Staying Curious (Ep. 142) - Conversations with Tyler](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/stewart-brand/)
* I found this _really_ intriguing, some weird californian marriage of socialism and capitalism that fuelled the idealism of many computer pioneers ???

> I don’t think people know the extent to which the mob took over (Bay Area in the 1960s). At first pornography — there was some really, really creative pornography coming out of basically hippie artists having a good time and turning the camera on. Then the whole dope culture. “No hope without dope.” Everybody was selling or buying marijuana and these other drugs from each other. Then one of the guys, named Super Spade — his arms and legs cut off, and his torso was hung out by Ocean Beach from a tree. And this knowledge of, well, those amateur days of drug sales are gone now, and the big-time players are here in town, and “Do not f — with us.” That was the end of that. Everybody who had been selling dope and learned a little bit of business from doing it, then went into business — legitimate business — and they were good at it. Hippies became, basically, very good commercial startup folks, partly because of that sequence of experiences.

#### Nobody Cared About My Spreadsheets
* Excel has been my passion and obsession and I consider the Excel bashing to be uninformed / opportunistic
* ...but always a great food for thought, here is a recent thread with Bryan Caplan's compaining that nobody looked into his _spreadsheets_ that served as an evidence for his _Case against Education_
* [No one cared about Bryan's spreadsheets - Marginal REVOLUTION](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/no-one-cared-about-bryans-spreadsheets.html)
* [No One Cared About My Spreadsheets - Econlib](https://www.econlib.org/no-one-cared-about-my-spreadsheets/)
* [On Bryan Caplan's spreadsheets](https://www.natemeyvis.com/writing/on-bryan-caplans-spreadsheets/)
* I consider to be the final verdict this
> If the initial data set is small, and you don't know that much about what kind of data you're storing, use a highly flexible, easy-to-modify format to store it (Excel). When the data set gets bigger and/or your knowledge about the data starts to crystalize, then migrate it (Database).
