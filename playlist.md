Focus on Licence Changes. I've watched too. Great changelog interview with ELK Stack Author. Great post by Antirez about his return to Redis (https://antirez.com/news/144)

#### 1.2. Ask HN: Programmers who don't use autocomplete/LSP, how do you do it?
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42492508>
Interesting debate on VIM vs IDE. I write Bash in Vim and Python in IDE (VSCode + iPython) and although enamoured by David Baeyzley's mastery, the IDE's just where I'm at with that particular language. To each his own, I think for this.

#### 1.3. Programming as Theory Building (1985) [pdf]
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592543>
Discussions of one of my favorite papers and favorite podcast episodes (Future of Code)

Return to this post as a refresher on SQL JOINs.

#### 1.7. Hotel California - by Benn Stancil - benn.substack
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/hotel-california?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=23588&post_id=154556809&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=25tz5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email>
On chaotic reality crashing into life filled with simulation.

#### 1.8. Remembering Mike Maples, Sr.
* <https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/remembering-mike-maples-sr>
All along, Mike created a culture of respect, collaboration, and most of all “promise and deliver”. He instilled in everyone the most basic notion of saying what you’re going to do and doing that well.

#### 1.9. Why Greenland Is Of Growing Strategic Significance
* <https://www.twz.com/news-features/why-greenland-is-of-growing-strategic-significance>

#### 1.11. AI’s Uneven Arrival – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/>
An eye-opener for o3. This is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models. For context, ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o. All intuition about AI capabilities will need to get updated for o3, which performs at 75% for ths test.

#### 1.12. The Origins of Wokeness
* <https://paulgraham.com/woke.html>
We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something that we'd previously been able to say, our initial assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent something from being said will usually claim they're not merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm; they have to prove it.

#### 1.13. Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams - Software Engineering Daily
* <https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams>
the manifesto is getting a rewrite, driven by Heroku but being worked on collectivelly as an open-source project, great chat on current state of Heroku as well.

#### 1.14. Principles - Nabeel S. Qureshi
* <https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/principles?publication_id=107423&utm_campaign=email-post-title&r=3o9&utm_medium=email>
“Aim for Chartres” (Christopher Alexander) — when doing something, aim to be the best there ever was at it. This compensates for your natural bias, which is to do something mediocre. You have to really aim to be as good as the greats.

#### 1.15. Show HN: GUI for editing Mermaid class diagrams
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738656>

#### 1.16. The quiet rebellion of a little life
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769751>
Near as I can tell there is a not-insignificant part of the American psychological context that amounts to a threat of utter destitution should you not choose to keep slaving away. By Krom, America needs homeless people to show you just how far you can fall unless you keep serving the man.

#### 1.17. AI Slop, Suspicion, and Writing Back
* <https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/01/25/AI-Slop-Suspicion-and-Writing-Back/>
I do AI slop as well and I own it on my blog.

#### 1.18. From open source to acquired with Ashley Jeffs (Changelog Interviews #625)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/625>
On Benthos Stream Processing, from OS to being bought by Red Panda. Very funny at times, the humor there seemed like instilled in Benthos itself.

#### 1.19. Jinja (template engine) - Wikipedia
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)>
Using Jinja for a simpler task as it was a first thing that occured to me. I should have just used a built-in Template module though. I did not need any programming logic in the template just a simple placeholders.

#### 1.20. Good Lord - by Benn Stancil - benn.substack
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord>
Such a brave critique of the politics of current Silicon Valley and catching its own hypocricies. Amazing and inspiring.

#### 1.21. Antiqua et Nova: Note on the relationship between AI and human intelligence
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877709>
Vatican's take on AI and many respectful voices on Hacker News. I can still get surprised!

### 2. FEB-2025
#### 2.1. Don't Believe Him (by Ezra)
* <https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html>
Perception cannot become reality so easily. Can it?

#### 2.2. Introducing self-describing JSONs
* <https://snowplow.io/blog/introducing-self-describing-jsons>
Learning about semi-structured data, this self-describing JSON approach rhymes with that.

#### 2.3. 49 Small Truths About Marriage All Couples Understand - Fatherly
* <https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/truths-about-marriage>
Everyone thinks of leaving. That's just part of staying.

#### 2.4. Turso is rewriting SQLite in Rust with Glauber Costa, CEO at Turso (Changelog Interviews #626)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/626>
Listened to a great episode on SQLite itself on Corecursive Podcast in the past. Happy to see the challer on the block.

#### 2.5. Beej's Guide to Network Programming
* <https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/what-is-a-socket.html#what-is-a-socket>
Socket Programming featured in David Beazley's famous live coding - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4 - so as I am new to network programming, I'm glad to have some intro here to better enjoy the talk, really (not doing any of that myself)

#### 2.6. Trumpian policy as cultural policy - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/trumpian-policy-as-cultural-policy.html>
Another important take for me - on cultural change there already was one about "The vibes have changed" that came out before the election. This is an implementation of cultural change by "flooding the zone" by filling media with agenda, constant, without time taking for implementation. It's just an aggresive take on the existing discourse. Fascinating.

#### 2.7. Fallthrough & Friends with Matthew Sanabria & Kris Brandow (Changelog & Friends #77)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/77>
On documentation: what's often missing is I think my biggest gripe right now is just how few docs we have, how little documentation so many things have. But if there was a way… I think there was especially – what was it? There was one that was like the discover and learn steps. I am very frustrated often at libraries that I want to go in and understand, and there’s no “Oh, start looking here.” Or like “Here’s the basic architecture that you can then use to understand how this codebase is laid out, so you can go read the code and understand how we’ve implemented all of these things.” That documentation is almost always completely missing.

#### 2.8. QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer: Visual tool to explore SQLite databases page-by-page, the way they're stored on disk and the way SQLite sees them.
* <https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer>
SQLite (and most databases) store data in disk-block-sized pages, usually 4KB, which helps make reads and writes as fast as possible.

Normally developers interact with databases on the "schema level" - tables, rows, and SQL. But taking a peek at the "page level" can give you some interesting insights:

#### 2.9. Continuous reinvention: A brief history of block storage at AWS
* <https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/08/continuous-reinvention-a-brief-history-of-block-storage-at-aws.html>

#### 2.10. Marshmallow Test and Parenting - @desunit (Sergey Bogdanov)
* <https://desunit.com/blog/marshmallow-test-and-parenting/>
Could be applied just as well to working environments.

#### 2.11. Comments - Tech's Dumbest Mistake: Why Firing Programmers for AI Will Destroy Everything
* <https://defragzone.substack.com/p/techs-dumbest-mistake-why-firing/comments?utm_medium=web>

#### 2.12. Let Brandon Cook - Cal Newport
* <https://calnewport.com/let-brandon-cook/>

#### 2.13. Firing programmers for AI is a mistake
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010814>
Another long thread on HN about what AI is going to do to programmers. My thoughts are on Walter Benjamin§s essay on Art and Mechanical Reproduction.

Pre-warming my studies with memorization session.

#### 2.18. htop Explained Visually
* <https://codeahoy.com/2017/01/20/hhtop-explained-visually/>

#### 2.19. PBS - JOHN GARDNER - EDUCATION AND EXCELLENCE
* <https://www.pbs.org/johngardner/sections/writings_speech_1.html>
The things you learn in maturity aren't simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You leant not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions, if you have any, which you do. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent, but pays off on character.

You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you, they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.

* <https://benn.substack.com/p/achievement-here-and-there?publication_id=23588&utm_campaign=email-post-title&r=25tz5&utm_medium=email>
A variation of "The Current Thing" meme? Making pivoting the point, and the status of start-ups being greatly overestimated and being about marketing and attention grab then a more authentic value.

#### 2.26. Discovering discovery coding with Jimmy Miller (Changelog & Friends #80)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/80>

#### 2.27. Vim After Bram: A Core Maintainer on How They’ve Kept It Going - The New Stack
* <https://thenewstack.io/vim-after-bram-a-core-maintainer-on-how-theyve-kept-it-going/>
I am still on Vim. Tempted to go to Neo-Vim, but to not see outputs being worth it.  at the moment. But it may be a question of time if I get to writing Python and Bash in much higher velocity in Vim.

#### 2.32. Discovering discovery coding with Jimmy Miller (Changelog & Friends #80)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/80#transcript>
But I think the key to get into discovery coding is to be willing to not have a solution in mind. I do think that that is easier said than done. I think it’s very, very tempting anytime you’re approaching programming problems to come with solutions. And I don’t know, it sounds almost silly when I say it, but I’ve found that to be the number one thing that stops me from finding the good solutions, is that I already have a solution in mind, even if it’s just in the back of my head, and as I’m going and doing this, I will just automatically go towards that solution.

So step one, clear your mind, meditate… No solutions. Step two I really think is ask questions. Ask questions about the codebase, about the problem, about whatever it is that is this situation you’re in, and try to find the answers for those. And if the answers are frustrating to find, if it just takes too long to find them, build a tool that makes it really easy. And if you start there, the process of discovery coding will start becoming the easy default, because every time you want to have an answer, you already have tools available to you to help find that answer, and that ends up being like your inspiration for how to continue.

So the goal is to try to make it easy to discovery-code, because if it’s not, you’re never gonna do it. So you kind of have to do the hard work up front.

#### 2.38. The Digital Antiquarian
* <https://www.filfre.net/>
Something that makes me highly nostalgic and that gives soul to the gaming as I remember it.

#### 2.39. Programming with LLMs featuring David Crawshaw (Changelog Interviews #629)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/629>
A different take on AI assisted coding than one you have from Primagean, who is much more skeptical. This is more specific, building Go-specific tooling and being passionate about what LLMs can do for us. Also appreciating how code-completion is a completely different paradigm than a chat-bot for AI and how cool that is, pionereed by GitHub Copilot. I am not turning it back on, I don't depend on the amount of code I write for my paycheck so I rather write by myself, working through the problems alone. Or with occational oblique strategy. Still, it is fascinating what is happening, utterly mezmerizing to watch that.

#### 2.40. New Junior Developers Can’t Actually Code
* <https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning>
Clickbait and Moral Panic or it is really different? I am surely cautious. But the great plus is you CAN build things that until now needed code. If your focus is on craft - no. If your focus is on value - absolutely.

#### 2.41. Change my mind (Changelog & Friends #81)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/81>
Primagean is covering the same piece in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnpUK-f87zo&t=58s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime.

#### 2.42. GenAI hot takes and bad use cases (Practical AI #304)
* <https://changelog.com/practicalai/304>
What's LLM are currently not good for: high throughput/low latency usecases, complete autonomy, high-stakes forecasting, not top languages (both of human and computer world), ... there is more and great!

#### 2.43. The return of the modern data stack - by Benn Stancil
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/the-return-of-the-modern-data-stack?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=23588&post_id=157625068&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=25tz5&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email>
So much fun! Which, sure, this is how databases work now. About ten years ago, they got split in half, into a bucket of data on one side, and a compute engine that runs calculations on the other. So long as the buckets are formatted correctly, you can mix and match different buckets with different calculators.

But this SAP product, if it works the way I think it does, extends that idea in a couple of new ways. First, it suggests that applications, like CRMs and ERPs to CPQs and ATSs, could be one of the buckets that databases connect their calculators to. Rather than exporting data out of SAP—which is how people have done this for a while, and it clearly hasn’t gone well—SAP can simply reformat it. Then, people can bring their database—or, since it’s 2025, bring their aGeNtS—directly to the applications themselves.

#### 2.44. The End of Programming as We Know It – O’Reilly
* <https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/>
as read and commented on by primagean - [(4) The End Of Programming As We Know It - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C79mALqHI0o&t=1015s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime) and I currently agree that one should invest into not be made stupid and one should be defending ones skills - if you've already aqcuired them. Is it good for lifetime?

#### 4.6. Prime Reacts - Why I Stopped Using AI Code Editors - YouTube
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3_TY4K8hVE>
The same point again - reinforced - the loss of Fingerspitzgefuehl, the loss of intuition, the loss of the ability to interact fluently and after the loss the reaction to loss is really negative. May be similar to loss of fluency in a language though. It is not going to be lost completely. It just goes into background and you can refresh it after say a week of pratice if you have years of experience there.

A cynical take from The Killer: The Killer: From the beginning of history, the few have always exploited the many. This is the cornerstone of civilization. The blood in the mortar that binds all bricks. Whatever it takes, make sure you're one of the few, not one of the many.

#### 5.20. The ads are coming - by Benn Stancil - benn.substack
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/the-ads-are-coming>
When I see many people paying $20/month for GPT+ or Perplexity, I have an impression that the internet is about the undergo a transformation of its business model (+web3 may have a word to say there). That may be a temporary delusion.

#### 5.21. Its Finally Over For Devs (again, fr fr ong) - YouTube
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MUNWKQ9_9c&t=1178s>
The vibes have changed - another round. 3 things that make professional eng: communication+architecture(theory)+coding(practice). All three required. Amazing how Prime cut it at the moment it dawned on him the thing's written by the AI.

#### 5.22. Carson Gross

* <https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/232-from-typewriters-to-transformers>
Interesting that TS Kuhn's cyclical philosophy of history is raised here with the point that AI is a tool revolution rather than conceptual revolution. It is a new typewriter? No, golden retriver on Acid, as described by Zed editor creator in Changelog podcast. That fits the best I think!

* <https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/233-the-illusion-of-thinking-thoughts>
Stop Antropomorphizing AI; the expectations are too large; the trust is too large. The institutions like universities are reacting brutally to the misuse and that's prolly correct.

#### 5.32. Well-rounded doesn’t cut.
* <https://sive.rs/rounded>
AI-assisted synthesis? No, have voice, face, uniqueness during work with people. It's an extra spice and a necessary one. Also you know what you actually submit. Never submit shit.

* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7kXuVlo6tU&t=3528s&ab_channel=Changelog>
The model of non-devs knowledge workers having bespoke software (or changes) is I think coming. The optimism of Steve the juniors will be profers, guarantors, editors of that software is important. Still - also juniors need to create and get hands dirty asap.

Learn fundamentals. Stay close to hard thinking. Don't get carried away by access to Windsurf or any other "servant". >>> There is a lot to do, and I suspect in six months things will be very different again. Curiosity and humility will get us through it, but even more than usual I would suggest turning away from internet forums where people talk in circles about this technology. That is a job for an agent.

* <https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/are-you-stuck-in-movie-logic>
TSo John Bradshaw, the "inner child" meme author, taught that life is a series of problems that need to be confronted. This essay is about the first crucial step, and one of the most challenging thing in computer science — naming. Naming problem allows interacting with it. Naming is what wizards do in SICP. Also, my wife challenges my appreciation of 5 love languages basically by saying that love is mutual confrontation of problems and that begins with naming and sharig the problem. I still like to get gifts x)

#### 6.6. The Who Cares Era - YouTube
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILTJPYn_WTs&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime>
One of the "downsides" is not caring anymore if the relevation appears. Well you do care if you have skin in that game. Like being an academic and reading thesis AI generated. In my millieu, there are massive kick-outs from thesis defensese due to this. These people do care. Wider public? Probably not much. Benn Stancil has a great post on this in https://benn.substack.com/p/meme-company on cluely, providing an interesting analogy of what zero-cost content generation (with digital photography say) did with AI. People became important, not their works (MrBeast yes, but his specific video no).

Florence's wealth: Technology - import of 0 and arabic numerals + import of paper + invention of double entry accounting. Pretty cool.

#### 6.10. LLMs bring new nature of abstraction
* <https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-nature-abstraction.html>
Martin Fowler believes AI's not a hype. Change similar to the arrival of Higher Level languages and complier where you stopped writing against a particular instruction set. + non-determinism is a big one. Let's see. Still think that the best investment is into foundations and classics.

#### 6.11. Ezra Klein: The Case Against Writing With AI

#### 7.5. METR na X: AI slows down some?
* <https://x.com/METR_Evals/status/1943360399220388093>
Another big report on the downsides. The theory-building (Peter Naur) holds as essential. But most of the work is non-essential and this is where the AI seems to excel.

#### 7.6. My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts · The Fly Blog
* <https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/>
Some of the pro-AI voices are really strong however. The metaphor is that pro-CRAFT is in denial and riding horse carriages is powerful, yet - expertise is what matters after all. Results, too. But the first determines the latter.

#### 7.7. AI slows down open source developers. Peter Naur can teach us why.
* <https://johnwhiles.com/posts/mental-models-vs-ai-tools>
We know that the programmers in Metr's study are all people with extremely well developed mental models of the projects they work on. And we also know that the LLMs they used had no real access to those mental models. The developers could provide chunks of that mental model to their AI tools - but doing so is a slow and lossy process that will never truly capture the theory of the program that exists in their minds. By offloading their software development work to an LLM they hampered their unique ability to work on their codebases effectively.

#### 7.8. One Big Table (OBT)
* <https://www.ssp.sh/brain/one-big-table/>
A schema design from data warehousing as a counter to the traditional star/snowflake schema. Name seems eponymous with bigtable DB that preceded bigquery, i.e. from Google. Now a standard for many cloud native OLAP solutions, also ClickHouse.

It depends where you point your attention. How you think about it. So old. Oddyseus was curious about syren calls, but had himself attached to the pole... But sure the current craziness is even worth the curiousity.

#### 7.10. It's rude to show AI output to people

#### 7.14. How we built fast UPDATEs for the ClickHouse column store – Part 1: Purpose-built engines
* <https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-1-purpose-built-engines>
> In database systems, updates and analytics pull in opposite directions; what’s fast for one tends to be slow for the other.
> In row stores (like PostgreSQL or MySQL):
> Each row is stored contiguously on disk.
> This makes updates easy, you can overwrite a row in place.
> But analytical queries suffer: even if you need just two columns, the entire row must be loaded into memory.
> In column stores (like ClickHouse):
> Each column is stored in a separate file.
> This makes analytics blazing fast, only the columns you query are read.
> But updates are harder because each column is stored separately, modifying a row means touching multiple files and rewriting fragments.
> This tradeoff has long made efficient row-level updates a challenge for columnar systems.
