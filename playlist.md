#### Ask HN: Programmers who don't use autocomplete/LSP, how do you do it? 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42492508>
Interesting debate on VIM vs IDE. I write Bash in Vim and Python in IDE (VSCode + iPython) and although enamoured by David Baeyzley's mastery, the IDE's just where I'm at with that particular language. To each his own, I think for this.

#### Remembering Mike Maples, Sr.
* <https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/remembering-mike-maples-sr>

#### AI‚Äôs Uneven Arrival ‚Äì Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/>
An eye-opener for o3. This is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models. For context, ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o. All intuition about AI capabilities will need to get updated for o3, which performs at 75% for ths test.

#### The Origins of Wokeness
* <https://paulgraham.com/woke.html>
We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something that we'd previously been able to say, our initial assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent something from being said will usually claim they're not merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm; they have to prove it.

#### Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams - Software Engineering Daily
* <https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams>

‚ÄúAim for Chartres‚Äù (Christopher Alexander) ‚Äî when doing something, aim to be the best there ever was at it. This compensates for your natural bias, which is to do something mediocre. You have to really aim to be as good as the greats.

#### Show HN: GUI for editing Mermaid class diagrams 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738656>

#### The quiet rebellion of a little life 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769751>
Near as I can tell there is a not-insignificant part of the American psychological context that amounts to a threat of utter destitution should you not choose to keep slaving away. By Krom, America needs homeless people to show you just how far you can fall unless you keep serving the man.

#### AI Slop, Suspicion, and Writing Back

#### From open source to acquired with Ashley Jeffs (Changelog Interviews #625)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/625>
On Benthos Stream Processing, from OS to being bought by Red Panda. Very funny at times, the humor there seemed like instilled in Benthos itself.

#### Jinja (template engine) - Wikipedia
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)>
Using Jinja for a simpler task as it was a first thing that occured to me. I should have just used a built-in Template module though. I did not need any programming logic in the template just a simple placeholders.

#### Good Lord - by Benn Stancil - benn.substack
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord>
Such a brave critique of the politics of current Silicon Valley and catching its own hypocricies. Amazing and inspiring.

#### Antiqua et Nova: Note on the relationship between AI and human intelligence 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877709>

#### Beej's Guide to Network Programming
* <https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/what-is-a-socket.html#what-is-a-socket>
Socket Programming featured in David Beazley's famous live coding - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4 - so as I am new to network programming, I'm glad to have some intro here to better enjoy the talk, really (not doing any of that myself)

#### Trumpian policy as cultural policy - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/trumpian-policy-as-cultural-policy.html>
Another important take for me - on cultural change there already was one about "The vibes have changed" that came out before the election. This is an implementation of cultural change by "flooding the zone" by filling media with agenda, constant, without time taking for implementation. It's just an aggresive take on the existing discourse. Fascinating.

#### Fallthrough & Friends with Matthew Sanabria & Kris Brandow (Changelog & Friends #77)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/77>
On documentation: what's often missing is I think my biggest gripe right now is just how few docs we have, how little documentation so many things have. But if there was a way‚Ä¶ I think there was especially ‚Äì what was it? There was one that was like the discover and learn steps. I am very frustrated often at libraries that I want to go in and understand, and there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúOh, start looking here.‚Äù Or like ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the basic architecture that you can then use to understand how this codebase is laid out, so you can go read the code and understand how we‚Äôve implemented all of these things.‚Äù That documentation is almost always completely missing.

#### QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer: Visual tool to explore SQLite databases page-by-page, the way they're stored on disk and the way SQLite sees them.
* <https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer>
SQLite (and most databases) store data in disk-block-sized pages, usually 4KB, which helps make reads and writes as fast as possible.

Normally developers interact with databases on the "schema level" - tables, rows, and SQL. But taking a peek at the "page level" can give you some interesting insights:

#### PBS - JOHN GARDNER - EDUCATION AND EXCELLENCE
* <https://www.pbs.org/johngardner/sections/writings_speech_1.html>
The things you learn in maturity aren't simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You leant not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions, if you have any, which you do. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent, but pays off on character.

You come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you, they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.

#### Discovering discovery coding with Jimmy Miller (Changelog & Friends #80)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/80#transcript>
But I think the key to get into discovery coding is to be willing to not have a solution in mind. I do think that that is easier said than done. I think it‚Äôs very, very tempting anytime you‚Äôre approaching programming problems to come with solutions. And I don‚Äôt know, it sounds almost silly when I say it, but I‚Äôve found that to be the number one thing that stops me from finding the good solutions, is that I already have a solution in mind, even if it‚Äôs just in the back of my head, and as I‚Äôm going and doing this, I will just automatically go towards that solution.

So step one, clear your mind, meditate‚Ä¶ No solutions. Step two I really think is ask questions. Ask questions about the codebase, about the problem, about whatever it is that is this situation you‚Äôre in, and try to find the answers for those. And if the answers are frustrating to find, if it just takes too long to find them, build a tool that makes it really easy. And if you start there, the process of discovery coding will start becoming the easy default, because every time you want to have an answer, you already have tools available to you to help find that answer, and that ends up being like your inspiration for how to continue.

So the goal is to try to make it easy to discovery-code, because if it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre never gonna do it. So you kind of have to do the hard work up front.

#### The Digital Antiquarian

Something that makes me highly nostalgic and that gives soul to the gaming as I remember it.

#### Programming with LLMs featuring David Crawshaw (Changelog Interviews #629)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/629>
A different take on AI assisted coding than one you have from Primagean, who is much more skeptical. This is more specific, building Go-specific tooling and being passionate about what LLMs can do for us. Also appreciating how code-completion is a completely different paradigm than a chat-bot for AI and how cool that is, pionereed by GitHub Copilot. I am not turning it back on, I don't depend on the amount of code I write for my paycheck so I rather write by myself, working through the problems alone. Or with occational oblique strategy. Still, it is fascinating what is happening, utterly mezmerizing to watch that.

#### New Junior Developers Can‚Äôt Actually Code 
* <https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-and-learning>
Clickbait and Moral Panic or it is really different? I am surely cautious. But the great plus is you CAN build things that until now needed code. If your focus is on craft - no. If your focus is on value - absolutely.

#### The return of the modern data stack - by Benn Stancil

So much fun! Which, sure, this is how databases work now. About ten years ago, they got split in half, into a bucket of data on one side, and a compute engine that runs calculations on the other. So long as the buckets are formatted correctly, you can mix and match different buckets with different calculators.

But this SAP product, if it works the way I think it does, extends that idea in a couple of new ways. First, it suggests that applications, like CRMs and ERPs to CPQs and ATSs, could be one of the buckets that databases connect their calculators to. Rather than exporting data out of SAP‚Äîwhich is how people have done this for a while, and it clearly hasn‚Äôt gone well‚ÄîSAP can simply reformat it. Then, people can bring their database‚Äîor, since it‚Äôs 2025, bring their aGeNtS‚Äîdirectly to the applications themselves.

#### The End of Programming as We Know It ‚Äì O‚ÄôReilly

as read and commented on by primagean - [(4) The End Of Programming As We Know It - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C79mALqHI0o&t=1015s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime) and I currently agree that one should invest into not be made stupid and one should be defending ones skills - if you've already aqcuired them.
