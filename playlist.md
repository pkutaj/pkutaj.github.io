### 1. JAN 2023

#### 1.1. GitHub Copilot preliminary experience report
* <https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/12/05/github-copilot-preliminary-experience-report/>
* Notes on Experience with Github Pilot, similar to that of mine - it has the potential to surprise you, which is great. 
> I was, frankly, stunned. While I do understand that Copilot doesn't actually understand the code it suggests, Hedgehog is sufficiently esoteric that I didn't expect Copilot to have enough training data to enable it to make a useful contribution in this niche. I was wrong. I've repeatedly seen Copilot make suggestions to my F# and Haskell code. It's not just for C#, JavaScript, or python code.

#### 1.2. Free YouTube Transcripts
* <https://ytscribe.com/>
* For cases a transcription's required

#### 1.3. imaginAIry/README.md at master · brycedrennan/imaginAIry

* wow
 

#### 1.4. Overconfidence and AI
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/overconfidence-and-ai/>
* My friend told me "AI is bullshitting a lot" which Seth Godin kindly frames as overconfidence
> Human beings are often more effective when we’re a bit self-effacing. “I think,” “Perhaps,” or “I might be missing something, but…” are fine ways to give our assertions a chance to be considered.

#### 1.5. Fighting Distraction With Unit Tests
* <https://matthewc.dev/musings/unit-tests/>
* A hemmingway-style approach to writing code where you stop at writing the failing unit test as a sort of cliffhanger. 
> n/a

#### 1.6. ChatGPT Is Only Going to Get Better, and We Better Get Used to It - Bloomberg
* <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-23/chatgpt-is-only-going-to-get-better-and-we-better-get-used-to-it?utm_content=view&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&sref=htOHjx5Y>
* AI is developing in leaps - mind you.
> I ’ve started dividing the people I know into three camps: those who are not yet aware of LLMs; those who complain about their current LLMs; and those who have some inkling of the startling future before us. The intriguing thing about LLMs is that they do not follow smooth, continuous rules of development. Rather they are like a larva due to sprout into a butterfly. It is only human, if I may use that word, to be anxious about this future. But we should also be ready for it.

#### 1.7. Key Metrics for Monitoring AWS Fargate
* <https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/aws-fargate-metrics/>
* How to Monitor ECS Fargate
> 

#### 1.8. Amazon ECS container logs for EC2 and Fargate launch types - AWS Prescriptive Guidance
* <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/ec2-fargate-logs.html>
* ECS does not have replicas or pods but it talks about tasks
> 

#### 1.9. How to Profile Your Code in Python
* <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-profile-your-code-in-python-e70c834fad89>
* I am wondering why function that I expect to take shorter is taking longer for leetcode puzzles
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

#### 1.10. ChatGPT's killer enterprise use case will be managing knowledge, says EY CTO
* <https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpts-killer-enterprise-use-case-will-be-managing-knowledge-says-ey-cto/>
* Knowledge keeping, managing and providing seems to be a killer feature for Enterprise AI
> 

#### 1.11. The coming ubiquity - Seth's Blog
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-coming-ubiquity/>
* On the invisible revolution of making AI everywhere allthetime
> But the real impact of AI isn’t going to be that it regularly and consistently does far better than the best human effort. The impact will be that it is widespread, cheap and always there.

#### 1.12. SQL should be your default choice for data engineering pipelines
* <https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_sql/>
* After a wave of noSQL tools, this is what you get in the beginning of 2023
> SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It’s robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it’s clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.

#### 1.13. dylanjcastillo/shell-genie: Your wishes are my commands
* <https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie>
* Another cool project to get info on AI
> Shell Genie is a command-line tool that lets you interact with the terminal in plain English. You ask the genie what you want to do and it will give you the command you need.

#### 1.14. Natural language is the lazy user interface - Austin Z. Henley
* <https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html>
* A slight critique of chatgpt as an interface as it lacking a big advangates of adaptable GUI.
> People are anticipating that large language models are going to revolutionize the world. And maybe they will. But a chat bot won't.

#### 1.15. On Email and Horses - Study Hacks - Cal Newport
* <https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2023/01/25/on-email-and-horses/>

> The West has an old problem: that is fear. The West has always been afraid of the Soviet Union. It believed the USSR was big and powerful and could solve everything quickly through military means. No conclusions were made even after the USSR invaded Afghanistan in 1979. And they couldn’t do anything there against the uneducated, at that moment, the mujahideen. That is when a conclusion should have been made that the USSR is not that powerful.But those conclusions were not made. And the West kept on being afraid.

* And I say this as somebody who had been a hardened skeptic of the artificial intelligence hype for many years. Note that I didn’t say likely transform. It will transform higher education. Here’s why. The first use-case is that the machine “filters mundane questions,” as one of our students put it quite eloquently. Meaning: you can ask the dumb questions to the AI, instead of in-class. Yes, there are dumb questions—or at least there are questions where the answer is completely obvious to anybody who knows even just a little bit about, say, malware analysis (or has done their assigned readings).

> My overall view is this: it is a good rebuttal to “the unrealistic ones,” who don’t see the benefits of fossil fuels.  But it does not rebut a properly steelmanned case for a transition away from fossil fuels.I view the steelmanned case as this: we cannot simply keep on producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions for centuries on end.  We thus need some trajectory where — at a pace we can debate — carbon emissions end up declining.  I’ve stressed on MR many times that climate change is not in fact an existential risk, but it could be a civilization-destroying risk if we just keep on boosting carbon emissions without end.  I don’t know a serious scientist who takes issue with that claim.

I knew that a lot of it was talking about a product to people and finding new and interesting ways to use it, but a lot of that seemed too vague to really have any solid place to start from. It's like walking into an empty room and having no idea where to start decorating.At some level though, it felt right for me in a way that I have difficulty describing. It's the same feeling of it being right that I get from working in software in the first place. It felt like the type of rabbit-hole you could spend an entire career in

But in the meantime, my days are quite frustrating because I'm in teaching mode most of the time instead of building stuff.Unfortunately you will either need to change your attitude or change teams. In your position, the expectation is that you are mostly a working through others and acting as a force multiplier of their work....And in general, there are two ways to go. The first is to accept the fact that many senior engineering and most staff engineering gigs are more about this kind of mentorship approach than actually doing work. And basically accept that the prime "getting shit done" years of your career are done and you will mostly be working in this new way now.The second is to change jobs where you are back in the driver seat. As a senior engineer, these positions DO exist even at FAANG (over on my team, I am the most junior with 12 years of experience). However, the more senior you get, the harder it is to find a role like this, especially in big tech - its the rare exception. Startups and consulting gigs probably better align with wanting to be hands on keyboard, but at the price of a paycut.

> underestimate the amount of work needed to make improvements. We've been a year away from full self driving cars for the last six years, and it seems like people are getting more cautious in their timing around that instead of getting more optimistic. Robotic manufacturing- driven by AI- was supposedly going to supplant human labor and speed up manufacturing in all segments from product creation to warehousing, but Amazon warehouses are still full of people and not robots.What I've seen again and again from people in the field is a gross underestimation of the long tail on these problems. They see the rapid results on the easier end and think it will translate to continued process, but the reality is that every order of magnitude improvement takes the same amount of effort or more.On top of that there is a massive amount of subsidies that go into training these models. Companies are throwing millions of dollars into training individual models. The cost here seems to be going up, not down, as these improvements are made.I also think, to be honest, that machine learning researchers tend to simplify problems more than is reasonable. This conversation started with "highly scalable system from scratch, or an ultra-low latency trading system that beats the competition" and turned into "the parsing of and generation of this kind of code"- which is in many ways a much simpler problem than what op proposed. I've seen this in radiology, robotics, and self driving as well.Kind of a tangent, but one of the things I do love about the ML industry is the companies who recognize what I mentioned above and work around it. The companies that are going to do the best, in my extremely bias opinion, are the ones that use AI to augment experts rather than try to replace them. A lot of the coding AI companies are doing this, there are AI driving companies that focus on safety features rather than driver replacement, and a company I used to work for (Rad AI) took that philosophy to Radiology. Keeping experts in the loop means that the long tail isn't as important and you can stop before perfection, while replacing experts altogether is going to have a much higher bar and cost.

> A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated.The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined.If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.

However, its enterprise edition brings in a wide range of plugins (made either by Countly or by third-party developers) that provide advanced features such as HTTP performance monitoring, funnels with goals and completion rates, A/B testing, and so on. Overall, Countly's community edition is a reasonably rich offering for companies with mobile apps or that are selling products online, and it provides the option to upgrade to the enterprise version later if more is needed.

* Almost hegelian definition of personhood as the crucial moment seems to be the moment of Acknowledgement as person ? 
> The Copernican MomentSo what’s being stripped away here? And how?The what is easy. It’s personhood.By personhood I mean what it takes in an entity to get another person treat it unironically as a human, and feel treated as a human in turn. In shorthand, personhood is the capacity to see and be seen.This is obviously a circular definition, but that’s not a problem so long as we have at least one reference entity that we all agree has personhood. Almost any random human, like me or you (I’m not entirely sure about a few, but most people qualify), will do. So long as we have one “real person” in the universe, and agree to elevate any entity they treat unironically as a person as also a person, in principle, we can tag all the persons in the universe.In Martin Buber’s terminology (ht Dorian Taylor for suggesting this way of looking at it), X is a person if another person relates to it in an I-you way rather than an I-it way.

> The typical course on programming teaches a “tinker until it works” approach. When it works, students exclaim “It works!” and move on. Sadly, this phrase is also the shortest lie in computing, and it has cost many people many hours of their lives. In contrast, this book focuses on habits of good programming, addressing both professional and vocational programmers.By “good programming,” we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum.

For example, when dividing 20 (the dividend) by 3 (the divisor), the quotient is "6 with a remainder of 2" in the Euclidean division sense, and 623

> Sometimes a single incident efficiently summarizes a larger trend. So it is with New York University’s selection of its new president, Linda Mills, a licensed clinical social worker and an NYU social work professor. She researches trauma and bias, as well as race and gender in the legal academy. She is a documentary filmmaker and teaches advocacy filmmaking. She serves as an NYU vice chancellor and as a senior vice provost for Global Programs and University Life. In all these roles, Mills is the very embodiment of the contemporary academy. The most significant part of her identity, however, and the one that ties the rest of her curriculum vitae together, is that she is female, and thus overdetermined as NYU’s next president.

Now I don’t like to play “the PC card,” and if a process generates a lot of nerdy white guys, I don’t then assume that process is necessarily biased or requiring correction.  Still, the fact that my list creates so much room for women (and non-whites) suggests it reflects the universality of human experience more than what most of you came up with.

* <https://peps.python.org/pep-0435/>
* Python has an ENUM type which was not known to me until studying <https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data>
> The properties of an enumeration are useful for defining an immutable, related set of constant values that may or may not have a semantic meaning. Classic examples are days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) and school assessment grades (‘A’ through ‘D’, and ‘F’). Other examples include error status values and states within a defined process.It is possible to simply define a sequence of values of some other basic type, such as int or str, to represent discrete arbitrary values. However, an enumeration ensures that such values are distinct from any others including, importantly, values within other enumerations, and that operations without meaning (“Wednesday times two”) are not defined for these values. It also provides a convenient printable representation of enum values without requiring tedious repetition while defining them (i.e. no GREEN = 'green').

> Last week, columbia university became the latest school to announce that it would no longer require SAT or ACT scores for undergraduate admissions. The school’s decision was “rooted in the belief that students are dynamic, multi-faceted individuals who cannot be defined by any single factor,” the college said in a defense of its policy change.The SAT has faced heavy scrutiny for privileging rich families, which can pay for test-prep classes for their kids. Some believe that dropping the test is an ethical move toward equality in selective college admissions. Others argue that Columbia is replacing one metric skewed toward rich students with a bundle of metrics that are even more stratified by socioeconomic status, such as high GPAs, internships in Nicaragua, and expensive traveling soccer teams.

> That is the new book by Nigel Biggar, and it has already created a storm of controversy because of his claims that the British empire is, in my words, “underrated.”Let me first say that I am in no way upset at this thesis being put explicitly on the table.  And the book has many valuable discussions, covering issues such as how hard (at some point) the British worked to ban slavery, what were their motives for empire, what kinds of pressures for assimilation were asserted, and much more.My disappointment is how little space is devoted to the topic of sustainable economic growth.  In which parts of the empire did British rule boost sustainable economic growth, relative to a counterfactual of peaceful interaction but no conquest?  Singapore and Hong Kong seem obviously much richer and better off due to earlier British rule.  Malaysia likely as well, though the magnitude of the gain there is smaller.  But Sierra Leone not?  The country is miserably poor and has had numerous years of civil war, with a legacy of slavery as well.  Who could object to trying another run of history there, removing the British imperial role?  It is hard to see that it could get very much worse.  But then where does one put Kenya?

> Conditioning on completing the task, the average completion time from the treated group is 71.17 minutes and 160.89 minutes for the control group. This represents a 55.8% reduction in completion time. The p-value for the t-test is 0.0017, and a 95% confidence interval for the improvement is between [21%, 89%]. There are four outliers with time to completion above 300 min. All outliers are in the control group, however our results remain robust if these outliers are dropped. This result suggests that Copilot increases average productivity significantly in our experiment population. We also find that the treated group’s success rate is 7 percentage points higher than the control group, but the estimate is not statistically significant, with a 95% confidence interval of [-0.11, 0.25].

Not that Altman does not say - we wanted this to be a government project and it failed or that he is not 'building in public' to make everyone every (and others join) or that he is pro-regulatory.

#### 4.3. How will AI transform childhood? - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/how-will-ai-transform-childhood.html>
* There is a general idea that digital technogy gets us information and makes us stupid, or at least intellectually weaker. I am a strong believer of a modular approach; the "devices" should be first and foremost "removables" before they become anything else and we should be able to peacefully walk and contemplate life without any need to get satisfaction via "digital assistant". Of course, also this idea has stupid at the edge (how autonomy do want, there are people living a happy life absolutely disconnected, but does that scale?). In any case, sure, AI for kids, but not if that makes him a stupid addict. 
> Many parents may be reluctant to let their kids become attached to an AI. But I predict that most families will welcome it. For one, parents will be able to turn off the connection whenever they wish. Simply clicking a button is easier than yanking an iPad out of a kid’s grasp.Most of all, letting your kid have an AI companion will bring big advantages. Your child will learn to read and write much faster and better, and will do better in school. Or maybe you want your kid to master Spanish or Chinese, but you can’t afford an expensive tutor who comes only twice a week. Do you want your child to learn how to read music? The AI services will be as limited or as expansive as you want them to be.It is an open question how quickly schools will embrace these new methods of learning. At some point, however, they will become part of the curriculum. Competitive pressures will make parents reluctant to withhold AI from their kids. Even if the AIs are not present in the classroom, some kids will use them to help do their homework, gaining a big advantage, and the practice will likely spread.Of course children will use these AIs for purposes far beyond what their parents intend. They will become playthings, companions, entertainers and much more. When I was a kid, with no internet and mediocre TV, I created imaginary worlds in the dirt, or with simple household items, and my parents often had no clue. The AI services will become part of this model of spontaneous play, even if parents try to make them purely educational.What about teenagers? Well, many parents may allow their kids to speak with AI therapists. It might be better than nothing, and perhaps better than many human therapists.

> Now for the fifth argument. It has to do with the influence of the tool we are trying to use upon our own thinking habits. I observe a cultural tradition, which in all probability has its roots in the Renaissance, to ignore this influence, to regard the human mind as the supreme and autonomous master of its artefacts. But if I start to analyse the thinking habits of myself and of my fellow human beings, I come, whether I like it or not, to a completely different conclusion, viz. that the tools we are trying to use and the language or notation we are using to express or record our thoughts, are the major factors determining what we can think or express at all! The analysis of the influence that programming languages have on the thinking habits of its users, and the recognition that, by now, brainpower is by far our scarcest resource, they together give us a new collection of yardsticks for comparing the relative merits of various programming languages.

> While I defend the existence and utility of IQ and its principal component, general intelligence or g,  in the study of individual differences, I think it’s completely irrelevant to AI, AI scaling, and [existential risk from AI]. It’s a measure of differences among humans within the restricted range they occupy, developed more than a century ago. It’s a statistical construct with no theoretical foundation, and it has tenuous connections to any mechanistic understanding of cognition other than as an omnibus measure of processing efficiency (speed of neural transmission, amount of neural tissue, and so on). It exists as a coherent variable only because performance scores on subtests like vocabulary, digit string memorization, and factual knowledge intercorrelate, yielding a statistical principal component, probably a global measure of neural fitness.In that regard, it’s like a Consumer Reports global rating of cars, or overall score in the pentathlon. It would not be surprising that a car with a more powerful engine also had a better suspension and sound system, or that better swimmers are also, on average, better fencers and shooters. But this tells us precisely nothing about how engines or human bodies work. And imagining an extrapolation to a supervehicle or a superathlete is an exercise in fantasy but not a means to develop new technologies.

* I really enjoyed the first part when the popular image of tracking was framed as a scene from the movie Das Leben den Anderen. This did not contain such a gem, but boiling down the purpose of tracking to the discovery of 1) origins 2) intentions works elegantly and is supplied with clear illustrations. 
> Here’s a practical example to help you understand how this traffic information is essential: let’s say you run an ecommerce store for sneakers and suddenly you have an unexpected burst of sales on a particular item; you normally sell 10 pairs a week, and suddenly you get orders for 100 in a day! What happened? You turn to your traffic data, and you find that most of the new orders came from people who had gone directly to the page via a link on a blog for sneaker collectors. With this information you can reach out to the blog owner and discuss potential business opportunities, for example some kind of affiliate deal or a collaboration.Without the detailed traffic data, all you would have known was that you had a big spike in orders, and … that’s it! There would be no way to really capitalize on it.

What’s the argument against this?Robin: I think you’re right that there’s this very common phenomenon whereby most people have some sort of default views about the world and history and the future, and then some smaller groups come to a contrary view, that is a view that on the face of it would seem unlikely from some broad considerations. And then they develop a lot of detailed discussion of that, and then they try to engage that with the larger world, and then what they get usually is a big imbalance of attention, in the sense that they...Think of 9/11 truthers or something, right? They’re going to talk about this building and this piece of evidence and this time and this testimony or something, and people on the outside are just going to be talking mainly about the very idea of this thing, and is this at all plausible? And the insiders are going to be upset that they don’t engage all their specific things, and they introduce terminology and concepts and things like that, and they have meetings or they invite each other to talk a lot. And the outsiders are just at a different level of, does this really make much sense at all?And then, when the insiders are trying to get more attention and the outsiders, some of them will engage. There’ll be a difference between some very high profile people who just give very dismissive comments, versus lower status people who might look at their stuff in more detail, and they’re just going to be much more interested in engaging that first group than the second because the fact that somebody high profile even discussed them is something worthy of note. And then, the fact that this person was very dismissive and doesn’t really know much of their details, in their mind supports their view that they’re right and the other people are just neglecting them.So here, the key thing to notice is just, on the face of it, they’re postulating something that seems a priori pretty unlikely relative to a background of the past and other sorts of things. That would be the crux of the main response, is to say, look, what are you proposing here, and how would that look if we had seen it in the past? How unusual would that be?

They are aggressively integrating it into their products which (1) provides a relatively cheap step function upgrade and (2) keeps the barrier high for startups to use AI as their wedge.I attribute the speed at which incumbents are integrating AI into their products to a couple things:* Whereas AI was a hand-wavey marketing term in the past, it's now the real deal and provides actual value to the end user.* The technology and DX with integrating w/products from OpenAPI, SD, is good.* AI and LLMs are capturing a lot of attention right now (as seen easily by how often they pop up on HN these days).

Their picture of the West, then, is of the West in the past, of aWest in which culture had not yet entirely bowed out.With this in mind, I want to stress a significant circumstance: the Central European revoltswere not nourished by the newspapers, radio, or television—that is, by the "media." Theywere prepared, shaped, realized by novels, poetry, theater, cinema, historiography, literaryreviews, popular comedy and cabaret, philosophical discussions—that is, by culture.[15] Themass media—which, for the French and Americans, are indistinguishable from whatever theWest today is meant to be—played no part in these revolts (since the press and televisionwere completely under state control). While still shaken by this triply tragic event which the invasion of Prague represented, Iarrived in France and tried to explain to French friends the massacre of culture that had takenplace after the invasion: "Try to imagine! All of the literary and cultural reviews wereliquidated! Every one, without exception! That never happened before in Czech history, noteven under the Nazi occupation during the war." Then my friends would look at me indulgently with an embarrassment that I understood onlylater. When all the reviews in Czechoslovakia were liquidated, the entire nation knew it, andwas in a state of anguish because of the immense impact of the event.[17] If all the reviews inFrance or England disappeared, no one would notice it, not even their editors. In Paris, evenin a completely cultivated milieu, during dinner parties people discuss television programs,not reviews. For culture has already bowed out. Its disappearance, which we experienced inPrague as a catastrophe, a shock, a tragedy, is perceived in Paris as something banal andinsignificant, scarcely visible, a non-event.

> Now, the reason we’re doing this work is because we want to minimize those downsides while still letting society get the big upsides, and we think it’s very possible to do that. But it requires, in our belief, this continual deployment in the world, where you let people gradually get used to this technology, where you give institutions, regulators, policy-makers time to react to it, where you let people feel it, find the exploits, the creative energy the world will come up with — use cases we and all the red teamers we could hire would never imagine.And so we want to see all of the good and the bad, and figure out how to continually minimize the bad and improve the benefits. You can’t do that in the lab. This idea that we have, that we have an obligation and society will be better off for us to build in public, even if it means making some mistakes along the way — I think that’s really important.

* <https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/tom-holland/>
* He says many wonderful things and this episode introduced me to (since then) my favorite 'The Rest is History' podcast, but the celebration of curiosity on the side of Herodotus is possibly the most memorable one. 
> What I learned about modernity from Herodotus is that I think the quality about Herodotus that I have always loved — he’s always been my favorite writer, not just my favorite ancient writer but my favorite writer. He was the first classic writer I read. I’ve re-read him, I’ve reinterpreted him, I’ve translated him.I realized, as I was writing it, what I loved was the infinite curiosity that he has about everything. His writings are called Historia, which in Greek basically means researches, inquiries. It doesn’t mean history in the sense that we have. He is writing about the past. He says that this is his aim, but he’s not exclusively writing about the past.He’s writing about wild animals, he’s writing about rivers, he’s writing about wonders in different lands. He’s writing about how Egyptian men squat to go to the toilet and Egyptian women stand up, and how Scythians get stoned on bongs, and all kinds of extraordinary, mad, weird, fascinating stuff. He was called, in antiquity, the father of lies because there were lots of people who felt that he was just making it all up. I think that’s incredibly harsh. Often, many of the things that he was doubted for, he’s been vindicated.I was translating Herodotus, and I was able to use the internet as I was doing it. If there was a subject’s name or something, I wouldn’t have to go to a book to look it up. I could look it up online. I realized — it brought home to me how arrogant it is for us to sit in judgment on him when he was the first person to be doing this. He was the first person to be pursuing the infinite curiosity he felt about the vast expanse of everything to its absolute limits and so, of course, he got things wrong. We would. He didn’t have the internet. He didn’t have an example of Herodotus. Herodotus didn’t exist. There was no Herodotus before Herodotus. He’s doing it for the first time.I think that the sense of curiosity that the modern world is all about — we have access to more knowledge than is beyond the wildest dreams of previous generations, and we can follow it wherever we want.Herodotus, for me, stands at the head of that tradition, the head of that fascination with the vastness, the infinitude of the world and the universe that we inhabit. I look at modernity, and Herodotus sharpens for me a sense of how extraordinary and wonderful it is that we can know everything that we do, and that we have access to all the sources of information that we have. It’s a wonderful, wonderful thing, an incredible privilege of being alive in 2023.

* the fusion of pragmaticism and romanticism is what makes some of the insights extremely attractice
> COWEN: Did your poetry converge or diverge with your work at General Foods and this military organization?GIOIA: Well, my poetry was transformed by working in business. It probably could’ve happened at other companies too, but if you think about this, most poets in the United States have been in school since they were 6. At 65, they’re still in school, their whole vision of the world is of a schoolroom, of a university. I was basically working with very intelligent, nonliterary people for 15 years. In the same way in Washington DC, I was working with highly intelligent, highly competitive, but nonliterary people. It changes your sense of language, it changes your sense of the audience. I think I would’ve been a worse poet had I not gone into business in a business school.Another reason why I was probably good is that I suffered in a way because I was working ten, twelve hours a day doing this other thing, then I was squeezing my writing into late nights and weekends. I do believe, as the jazz musicians say, you got to pay your dues. If your art isn’t so good that you’re willing to suffer for it, willing to sacrifice for it, you’re not getting deeply enough down inside you.

* The weird thing to me is the bet that AI is a more radical change then all computing altogether. Can't identify with this bet at this point (2023-04-17).
> In several of my books and many of my talks, I take great care to spell out just how special recent times have been, for most Americans at least.  For my entire life, and a bit more, there have been two essential features of the basic landscape:1. American hegemony over much of the world, and relative physical safety for Americans.2. An absence of truly radical technological change.Hardly anyone you know, including yourself, is prepared to live in actual “moving” history.  It will panic many of us, disorient the rest of us, and cause great upheavals in our fortunes, both good and bad.  In my view the good will considerably outweigh the bad (at least from losing #2, not #1), but I do understand that the absolute quantity of the bad disruptions will be high.I am reminded of the advent of the printing press, after Gutenberg.  Of course the press brought an immense amount of good, enabling the scientific and industrial revolutions, among many other benefits.  But it also created writings by Lenin, Hitler, and Mao’s Red Book.  It is a moot point whether you can “blame” those on the printing press, nonetheless the press brought (in combination with some other innovations) a remarkable amount of true, moving history.  How about the Wars of Religion and the bloody 17th century to boot?  Still, if you were redoing world history you would take the printing press in a heartbeat.  Who needs poverty, squalor, and recurrences of Ghenghis Khan-like figures?

* <http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html>
* A foundational paper that the recent popularit of ANKI stands. 
> Given how central memory is to our thinking, it's natural to ask whether computers can be used as tools to help improve our memory. This question turns out to be highly generative of good ideas, and pursuing it has led to many of the most important vision documents in the history of computing. One early example was Vannevar Bush's 1945 proposal** Vannevar Bush, As We May Think, The Atlantic (1945). for a mechanical memory extender, the memex. Bush wrote:A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.The memex vision inspired many later computer pioneers, including Douglas Engelbart's ideas about the augmentation of human intelligence, Ted Nelson's ideas about hypertext, and, indirectly, Tim Berners-Lee's conception of the world wide web** See, for example: Douglas Engelbart, Augmenting Human Intellect (1962); Ted Nelson, Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate (1965); and Tim Berners-Lee, Information Management: a Proposal (1989).. In his proposal for the web, Berners-Lee describes the need for his employer (the particle physics organization CERN) to develop a collective institutional memory,a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organization and the projects it describes.These are just a few of the many attempts to use computers to augment human memory. From the memex to the web to wikis to org-mode to Project Xanadu to attempts to make a map of every thought a person thinks: the augmentation of memory has been an extremely generative vision for computing.In this essay we investigate personal memory systems, that is, systems designed to improve the long-term memory of a single person. In the first part of the essay I describe my personal experience using such a system, named Anki...

* <https://seths.blog/2023/03/tom-peters/>
* I remember listening Peter's on a podcast with Kara Swisher
> I’d have to characterize it with a quick review of the story. “In Search of Excellence” was published in 1982. The research began in 1978 or so. The Americans, of course, came out of World War II kings of the hill with nobody even in second place, and then the Japanese had the audacity to do these things like build cars that work, and they got us in ship building and they got us in steel, but who the hell cares about that? The car is intimate to the American life fantasy. We were second in a way.There were a couple of guys at Harvard, Bob Hayes and Bill Abernathy, and they wrote a single article in the Harvard Business Review that was called “Managing Our Way to Economic Decline,” and they said too much marketing, too much finance, not enough product quality. We dittoed that in a way, but there was another part of the story that was interesting as well.I was at McKinsey at the time, and McKinsey was getting beaten up for the first time in its history by the Boston Consulting Group, and our managing director said, “We’ve got to have something to talk about.” He had all these famous projects on operations and strategy, and then he called me in. I was a junior person, which was bizarre. I just got my PhD from Stanford in organization effectiveness. I think that was the reason. He said, “Look,” he said, “We’re the smartest people in the world and we design the smartest strategies in the world and then our clients get out-implemented. Whose problem is it? What the hell is going on?”Our fundamental hypothesis was, yeah, the Americans are getting the crap beaten out of us, but there’s got to be some places that work. We went to some obvious places like IBM that at that point was so far No. 1 it wasn’t funny. We went to places — and this is weird to say in 2018 — I went to St. Paul on a cold day and talked to 3M. Nothing had been written about 3M. Also at the time, we went to a middle-sized company or a large middle-sized company. I myself as co-author. Bob Waterman at McKinsey office in San Francisco where the weirdos in theory were, according to McKinsey. We went 30 miles down the road and talked to this funny little company that nobody had ever heard of, and it’s reasonably well-known today, and it’s called Hewlett-Packard.The lid comes off the whole thing. There are a million ways to describe that, but at any rate, so we wrote this book called “In Search of Excellence.”

And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion – has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now – but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognized position in good society.

* Great take, from England, with humour, full of opinionated, moderate ideas and details. 
> Now, the French Revolution is not one event. It's a process. And it's not something that anybody plans. It's not a protest about inequality, which people often think. And nor is it an uprising of the poor against the rich. It's none of those things. Where it comes from, I guess, is that France has got three interlinked problems. One is there's a general kind of economic depression. There are economic discontent. Its population has massively exploded by far the most popular nation in Europe. But it's got huge unemployment. There's not enough jobs for everybody. Food prices have gone through the roof. There's not enough food being produced. So in other words, you've got a lot of people, let's say in Paris, you've got a third of the population of Paris. These are kind of young people. So they're in their 20s and 30s. They don't have a job. And they don't have any food. And they cross about it. And sort of discontent is rising. So that's the first thing. Second thing is that France is heavily indebted. Because of all these wars it's been fighting. Now, it's not the only country in Europe with debts. But it finds it's very hard to service its debts. It can't. Its tax raising system and its sort of political system is incredibly antiquated and complicated. And the king, Louis XVI, can't get enough money to pay his debts. So France is basically on the verge of bankruptcy. And the third thing that sort of compounds all that is just bad luck. They have a series of terrible harvests. There's a really, really bad weather. Terrible winter in 1788, 89. So people are starving on the streets.

> n this model trust is at the level of the verified individual: access (usually) depends on multi-factor authentication (such as a password and a trusted device, or temporary code), and even once authenticated an individual only has access to granularly-defined resources or applications. This model solves all of the issues inherent to a castle-and-moat approach:If there is no internal network, there is no longer the concept of an outside intruder, or remote workerIndividual-based authentication scales on the user side across devices and on the application side across on-premises resources, SaaS applications, or the public cloud (particularly when implemented with single-sign on services like Okta or Azure Active Directory).In short, zero trust computing starts with Internet assumptions: everyone and everything is connected, both good and bad, and leverages the power of zero transaction costs to make continuous access decisions at a far more distributed and granular level than would ever be possible when it comes to physical security, rendering the fundamental contradiction at the core of castle-and-moat security moot.

It is ever-accumulating, and never-ending. It is sometimes painful, but that is the way.Individual projects may come to an end, but the practices that made them possible do not. You may finish writing a book, or reach the end of a run, or understand how to fix an engine, but there is no point where you’ve written enough, you’ve worked out enough, you’ve learned enough. The practices never end, which means you get to keep improving.The practice leaves a path behind you to show you how far you have come and carves out a path ahead of you to show you where you can go.The practices of your life are your life. They form the path you follow, they are how you become what you want to become, they make you who you are and who the world wants you to be. You are not solely in charge of your practices or the path they form. The world gets a vote too. In the end that’s part of the practice too — adjusting to feedback from the world, your body, your life, your family, your friends. All of these things are part of the practice, all of them inform it.

* The Economist started, iirc, as part of the initiative against the corn laws, i.e. as one of the initial liberal initiatives. 
> ut when did England start seeing itself as a primarily commercial nation? When did the interests of its merchants and manufacturers begin to hold sway against the interests of its landed aristocracy? The early nineteenth century certainly saw major battles between these competing camps. When European trade resumed in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, an influx of cheap grain threatened the interests of the farmers and the landowners to whom they paid rent. Britain’s parliament responded by severely restricting grain imports, propping up the price of grain in order to keep rents high. These restrictions came to be known as the Corn Laws (grain was then generally referred to as “corn”, nothing to do with maize). The Corn Laws were to become one of the most important dividing lines in British politics for decades, as the opposing interests of the cities — workers and their employers alike, united under the banner of Free Trade — first won greater political representation in the 1830s and then repeal of the Corn

The piece titled "I've Discovered a New Class of System: the Customer Data Platform. Causata Is An Example," introduced the term CDP to the market for the first time.Tag management platforms were amongst the first to adopt this early definition of CDPs. In 2012, Google launched Google Tag Manager, a free tool allowing brands to manage their client-side web tracking. With a behemoth like Google releasing a free tool, household names in the tag management space no longer held the same value. They had to pivot their technology, focusing on data collection, a consolidated customer profile and activation through their integrations.CDPs were at the time seen as a solution to help brands build towards a single view of their customer and activate the data either through integrations with other tools or natively within their own tool's platform.So why aren't off-the-shelf CDPs the solution for every business?

* And exactly the UI i've always wanted. The next thing it could do is to create mindmaps!
> We shouldn’t be surprised by this. All technologies have tradeoffs.The typical response to criticisms of AI is “but what about a few years from now?” There’s a widespread assumption that AI’s current flaws, like software bugs, are mere programming slip-ups that can be solved by a software update. But its biggest limitations are intrinsic. AI’s strength is also its weakness. Its constraints are few and its capabilities are many—for better and for worse.The startups that come out on top of the AI hype wave will be those that understand generative AI’s place in the world: not just catnip for venture capitalists and early adopters, not a cheap full-service replacement for human writers and artists, and certainly not a shortcut to mission-critical code, but something even more interesting: an adaptive interface between chaotic real-world problems and secure, well-architected technical solutions. AI may not truly understand us, but it can deliver our intentions to an API with reasonable accuracy and describe the results in a way we understand.It’s a new kind of UI.There are pros and cons to this UI, as with any other. Some applications will always be better off with buttons and forms, for which daily users can develop muscle memory and interact at high speeds. But for early-stage startups, occasional-use apps, and highly complex business tools, AI can enable us to ship sooner, iterate faster, and handle more varied customer needs.We can’t ever fully trust AI—a lesson we’ll learn again and again in the years ahead—but we can certainly put it to good use. More and more often, we’ll find it playing middleman between the rigidity of a computer system and the anarchy of an organic one. If that means we can welcome computers further into our lives without giving up the things that make us human, so much the better.

#### 5.4. EA, AI, and the rationality community - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/04/ea-ai-and-the-rationality-community.html>
* Another great post on AI, filled with interesting ideas on how West Coast Movements (rationality community? EA?) are running the major AGI labs; how their teachings and worldviews (naive, perhaps) are driving them and how doomsters (they are not rationality/EA folks, I suppose) are pushing AI, hopefully, into the right hands (national security apparatus?)
> To this day, the Doomsters are de facto the greatest accelerationists.  Have you noticed how the Democrats (or Republicans) “own” certain political issues?  For instance, voters trust the Democrats more with Social Security, and the mere mention of the topic helps them, even if a Republican has a good point to make.  Well, the national security establishment “owns” the ideas of existential risk and risk from foreign powers.  The more you talk about doomsday issues, the more AI risk gets slotted into their purview, for better or worse

> ...the conflict which played itself out in the Hapsburg lands during these years was a political manifestation of the intellectual confrontation between the old guard and and their preoccupation with the mystical, spiritual and hermetic sciences, and the rise of a more rational and empirical view of the world. Rudolf, as the embodiment of the old philosophy, failed to grasp this profound shift in the prevailing climate and Professor Evans argues that it was this failure which led to his eventual tragic downfall.

#### 5.10. Prompt Engineering vs. Blind Prompting – Mitchell Hashimoto
* <https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-vs-blind-prompting>
* Personally a first look into methodical engineering practice behind prompting. 
> "Prompt Engineering" emerged from the growth of language models to describe the process of applying prompting to effectively extract information from language models, typically for use in real-world applications.A lot of people who claim to be doing prompt engineering today are actually just blind prompting.1 "Blind Prompting" is a term I am using to describe the method of creating prompts with a crude trial-and-error approach paired with minimal or no testing and a very surface level knowedge of prompting. Blind prompting is not prompt engineering.There is also a lot of skepticism about whether prompt engineering can truly be described as "engineering" or if it's just "witchcraft" spouted by hype-chasers. I think in most cases the skepticism is rooted in the fact that a lot of tweets and blog posts I've seen claiming to be on prompt engineering are really at best a thin layer above blind prompting.

* Fascinating thesis and yet another reason why religion study is wonderful
> The starting point for many analyses of European state development is the historical fragmentation of territorial authority. The dominant bellicist explanation for state formation argues that this fragmentation was an unintended consequence of imperial collapse, and that warfare in the early modern era overcame fragmentation by winnowing out small polities and consolidating strong states. Using new data on papal conflict and religious institutions, I show instead that political fragmentation was the outcome of deliberate choices, that it is closely associated with papal conflict, and that political fragmentation persisted for longer than the bellicist explanations would predict. The medieval Catholic Church deliberately and effectively splintered political power in Europe by forming temporal alliances, funding proxy wars, launching crusades, and advancing ideology to ensure its autonomy and power. The roots of European state formation are thus more religious, older, and intentional than often assumed.

Coming in early is never a problem, and in my experience, the best-case rarely happens. But it is important to capture how long something could take if things go poorly. Therefore, my uncertainty system starts with the expected time (captured above), and then applies an “if-things-go-wrong” multiplier

#### 5.16. madhadron - The seven programming ur-languages
* <https://madhadron.com/programming/seven_ur_languages.html#fn1>
* An assertion that most of modern languages are progeny of a single one - ALGOL, but that there are 6 more siblings in the family tree that have contemporary implementations that is worth looking at. Basically, an alternative to the three programming paradigms. 
> Every programmer needs to know a language in the ALGOL family well. Once you do, then it’s worth branching out. Learning a new language that traces to an unfamiliar ur-language each year will pay dividends. The languages I would suggest today in each of these families, and maybe in this order, are:Lisp: PLT RacketML: HaskellSelf: SelfProlog: PrologForth: gForth1APL: K (via ok)If you do a lot of numerical work, learn K earlier. If you do lots of embedded programming, learn gForth earlier. But the order is not important, nor is the exact language. You could learn Standard ML or OCaml instead of Haskell, Common Lisp instead of PLT Racket, and Factor instead of gForth with absolute impunity.

#### 5.21. Modular Docs - Why Mojo
* <https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html>

> The just-announced Mojo is a Python superset aimed at fixing Python’s performance and deployment problems. It has a great pedigree (Chris Lattner whom you may know from LLVM, Clang & Swift) and Fast.ai’s Jeremy Howard, who is also an advisor to Modular, Mojo’s creators, is very excited about it. Jeremy says: “I remember the first time I used the v1.0 of Visual Basic. Back then, it was a program for DOS. Before it, writing programs was extremely complex and I’d never managed to make much progress beyond the most basic toy applications. But with VB, I drew a button on the screen, typed in a single line of code that I wanted to run when that button was clicked, and I had a complete application I could now run. It was such an amazing experience that I’ll never forget that feeling. It felt like coding would never be the same again. Writing code in Mojo is the second time in my life I’ve had that feeling”

> Central Europe has always been more than merely the fault line between West and East. Even as Central European powers warred with their neighbors, the region developed its own cohesive identity and produced tremendous accomplishments in politics, society, and culture. Central Europeans launched the Reformation and Romanticism, developed the philosophy of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and advanced some of the twentieth century’s most important artistic movements.

* <https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/friction-over-debt>
* An attempt to re-frame the concept of technical debt as its original meaning of 'borrowing' at the time of high need so that you pay back later with interest has been lost to the business. Friction has much better face value. 
> By Kent BeckWard Cunningham told me about “technical debt” soon after he invented the phrase. He was working with fixed income traders who understood the financial uses of debt and wanted to explain to them why sometimes development went faster and sometimes it went slower.Since then “technical debt” has gone on to be the preferred explanation for development activities not directly resulting in features. “We need to pay down our technical debt.” [ed: auto complete suggested “technical debt”, which must be the modern definition of widespread usage]“That’s just an excuse for programmers to mess around.”

> Well, actually, the management techniques of Horatio Nelson would be a reasonable because he's a brilliant manager of his of his staff of his underlings, isn't he? Because he gets on fantastically well with the cast. Well, I think I think that's basically to work with Nelson was to adore him. That's what essentially everybody says. There are his peers who find him insufferable. You think he's he's bumpest. So a bit like a Churchill, a bit like with the young Churchill, but they think he's a metal hunter. They think he's fame hungry. They think he's annoying and windy and difficult and all those things. But the people who work for him worship him, don't they? Completely. Because his charisma, his courage, but also the way that he obviously loves his captains and loves his men. So Adam Nicholson, who wrote a brilliant book, Men of Honor, about Trafalgar, says that the people Nelson loved, a part of course, where ever Hamilton, his mistress, were his captains. And I think that that sense of a band of brothers

* Wonderful longread for something I don't see much - comparative (software) linguistics! 5* piece.
> I started programming in Rust several years ago, and it has gradually changed the way I design programs in other programming languages, most notably in Python. Before I started using Rust, I was usually writing Python code in a very dynamic and type-loose way, without type hints, passing and returning dictionaries everywhere, and occasionally falling back to “stringly-typed” interfaces. However, after experiencing the strictness of the Rust type system, and noticing all the problems that it prevents “by construction”, I suddenly became quite anxious whenever I got back to Python and wasn’t provided with the same guarantees.

> The defining Gramscian concept is that of hegemony. This denotes a level of political domination that extends beyond control of a state or a parliament into the realm of culture and ideas. Gramsci was preoccupied by the question of why the 1917 Russian revolution had not been followed by others in western Europe. He located the answer in the persistence of capitalist ideas among civil society institutions (political parties, trade unions, churches, the media). As he wrote: “The state was only an outer ditch, behind which there stood a powerful system of fortresses.”

#### 5.32. Windows and the AI Platform Shift – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2023/windows-and-the-ai-platform-shift/>
* The argument that AI is, after OS (Windows) a legitimate reason to move to Microsoft in 2023 is one that I have already fulfilled as I am using Bing as Mentor/UI multiple times a day and keep it open constantly. 
> It’s important to note that Windows persisted as the linchpin of Microsoft’s strategy for over three decades for a very good reason: it made everything the company did possible. Windows had the ecosystem and the lock-in, and provided the foundation for Office and Windows Server, both of which were built with the assumption of Windows at the center....Still, the very fact that Windows is suddenly interesting again, while a new Apple product faces a major software question, is evidence for Nadella’s argument that AI is a platform shift, and for the first time in a long time it is Microsoft that actually has a clear path to not just leveraging its base but actually expanding it.Apple, meanwhile, still dominates the platforms where AI will be used for the foreseeable future — ChatGPT released their app on iPhone first, after all — but then again, Windows was still the dominant platform for the first decade-and-a-half of the Internet. Ultimately, though, the Internet eroded Windows’ dominance and set the stage for the smartphone; surely Apple knows it ought not risk a similar erosion of differentiation at the hand of AI, particularly as they courageously build products beyond the iPhones.

#### 6.1. Where have all the hackers gone? + a way to discuss programming languages
* <https://morepablo.com/2023/05/where-have-all-the-hackers-gone.html>
* On discussing programming languages and many more. 
> Soil is the properties of running code in that language. Most of it is when the code is actually running (basic performance characteristics, "is it a binary or interpreted by a VM," scheduler and/or relationship to multicore/parallelism, garbage collector) but a more broad generalization is "everything that isn't code editing that doesn't directly involve "community,"" so I'll involve things like build times and some properties of its tooling. So the stuff I brought up in the Golang discussion are "soil," but so is:That Python code is often hundreds or thousands of times slower than other languages.Languages with long compile times (Scala, Kotlin) vs. short ones (Golang).If your language has generics, does it implement them with type erasure, monomorphization, or something else?Erlang having a preemptive scheduler, and how iolists + how string concatenation works under the hood mean you can render the template of doom.Surface is what people usually think about when comparing languages: the features! Source code! It's whether it has your favorite looping construct (or doesn't, per the "only need a for loop"). Syntax, FFI, which regexes it supports, the semantics of its specific object system. Other examples are:Less/Sass and CoffeeScript were pure "surface" plays: not about the core capabilities, but seemingly expanding them with pure "fixes" to suboptimal surfaces."Ruby is so much better than Java! Look at how you open a file in Java (shows you 30 lines) vs. Ruby! (2 lines)"Much of the appeal of MERN or MEAN stacks is that "it's all JavaScript/JSON," meaning you can reduce the amount of "surface" to learn.Strong reactions on both sides of CSS-in-JS and Tailwind feel "surface"-ey, though they can have "soil"-ey impacts.Finally atmosphere: these are things that aren't the language or its code, but the broader community. Hiring, Stack Overflow answers, number of stars on its popular GitHub projects, number of packages in their repositories. I'll go a little further and include downstream effects of that community, e.g. "does the language have a VSCode plugin and language server" seems to be more a function of atmosphere than the others:Most "you can hire React developers easily" is completely divorced from any technical discussion of React as a framework. Ditto Java, Python, Ruby, JS…Most of a language's culture: Elm and Clojure both have something like "if Evan/Rich didn't think you should have that thing you wanted, have you considered that maybe you're wrong? 🙂". Golang telling you you're dumb and wrong for wanting generics for a decade before shipping them. Scala having all that silly drama.

#### 6.6. Einstein's Final Quest
* <https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/faith-and-character/faith-and-character/einstein-s-final-quest.html>
* Last days of Einstein. 
> One day in April 1955, when he was working at his office on yet another set of unified field equations, Einstein began to feel a great pain in his stomach. He had long been plagued by an aneurism in his abdominal aorta, and it had started to rupture. A group of doctors convened at his home the next day, and they recommended a surgeon who might be able, though it was thought unlikely, to repair the aorta. Einstein refused. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially, he told his assistant Helen Dukas. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.He was taken to the Princeton hospital, where one of his final requests was for some notepaper and pencils so he could continue to work on his elusive unified field theory. He died shortly after one a.m. on April 18, 1955. By his bed were twelve pages of tightly written equations, littered with cross-outs and corrections. To the very end, he struggled to read the mind of the creator of the cosmos. And the final thing he wrote, before he went to sleep for the last time, was one more line of symbols and numbers that he hoped might get him, and the rest of us, just a little step closer to the spirit manifest in the laws of the universe.

* <https://calnewport.com/on-the-slow-productivity-of-john-wick/>
* I am experimenting with 0-notifications setup and this is confirming my hunch that the direction is a proper one. 
> What struck me as I watched this behind-the-scenes feature is how differently creatives who work in the arts think about productivity as compared to creatives who work in office jobs. For Keanu Reeves, it was obvious that the most productive path was to focus all of his attention on a single goal: becoming really good at Stahelski’s innovative brand of gun fu. Doing this, and basically only this, month after month, materialized hundreds of millions of dollar of profit out of the entertainment ether.In office jobs, by contrast, productivity remains rooted in notions of busyness and multi-faceted activity. The most productive knowledge workers are those who stay on top of their inboxes and somehow juggle the dozens of obligations, from the small tasks to major projects, hurled in their direction every week. Movie-making is of course different than, say, being a marketing executive, or professor, or project manager, but creating things that are too good to be ignored, regardless of the setting, is an activity that almost without exception requires undivided attention. Are we so sure that the definition of “productive” that defines knowledge work really is the most profitable use of our talents?

* He's witty and bold and, like in this essay, says eloquently what I've been wondering about formlessly, for some time already. 
> Imagine that an armed group in Texas or Yunnan launched a march on Washington or Beijing, announcing everything in advance on social media in messages laced with prison slang and threats to destroy everything in their way. Imagine further that the group quickly advances to the environs of the capital, while the central army authorities scramble to destroy motorways as a last resort to stop the marauders. On its way, the group shoots down a few helicopters and aeroplanes. Finally, as it approaches the seat of power, Washington or Beijing are forced to sign an armistice. As a Russian user joked on Twitter, “today we found out that, God forbid, if Nato attacks us, the most we will be able to do is to dig out the asphalt”. The former Belarusian presidential candidate Valery Tsepkalo commented: “Only unfamiliar and unknown individuals emerged to address the people, and everyone laughed at them wholeheartedly. It seemed as [if] nobody was governing the country.”The truth is out: there is no Russian state. There is a theatrical production called the Russian state, but for how long the production will run remains to be seen. As the Wagner tanks occupied the main roads in Rostov, a street sweeper was asked by a video blogger what he made of the situation. “Everything is going according to plan,” he said, sweeping some cigarette butts into the dustpan. It summarised the state of Russia in hilarious fashion.

#### 7.1. Viktor Ullmann - Wikipedia
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Ullmann>
* Just listened to one of his pieces - It's difficult to lose the beauty - on the radio and his last years deserve deep admiration.
> On 8 September 1942 he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Up to his deportation his list of works had reached 41 opus numbers and contained an additional three piano sonatas, song cycles on texts by various poets, operas, and the piano concerto Op. 25, which he finished in December 1939, nine months after the entry of German troops into Prague. Most of these works are missing. The manuscripts presumably disappeared during the occupation. Thirteen printed items, which Ullmann published privately and entrusted to a friend for safekeeping, have survived.The particular nature of the camp at Theresienstadt enabled Ullmann to remain active musically: he was a piano accompanist, organized concerts ("Collegium musicum", "Studio for New Music"), wrote critiques of musical events, and composed,[4] as part of a cultural circle including Karel Ančerl, Rafael Schachter, Gideon Klein, Hans Krása, and other prominent musicians imprisoned there. He wrote: "By no means did we sit weeping on the banks of the waters of Babylon. Our endeavor with respect to arts was commensurate with our will to live."[3]Overall, Ullmann "probably made the most significant contribution of any single individual to the musical life of Terezin", composing 20 works in the camp.[5]On 16 October 1944 he was deported to the camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where on 18 October 1944 he was killed in the gas chambers.

#### 7.5. How to Do Great Work
* <http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html>
* A great take on ambition
> Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.And that is what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.

* <https://morepablo.com/2023/06/creatives-industries.html>
* Instead of rockstars, the reference should be to that of surgeons
> What was behind the flames of Where have all the hackers gone?? The biggest one I'm conscious of is Kellan's Software and its Discontents series. It's an excellent set of articles that try to provide answers to the question "why is everyone so miserable about software these days?"I really loved it, but I felt it didn't articulate the overarching narrative I observed behind all the glum feelings: application software is no longer a game of "creatives" and "talents," it's now a "commodified sludge" version with a playbook on how to produce it. This playbook describes a game that's a) not fun or motivating for most of the people involved, b) based on risk management (fear) rather than outcome maximization (hope), and c)… still doesn't seem to work, actually? But everyone yells at you and calls you immature or Not Serious if you deviate?The labor/hiring market was very slow to catch up to this, so for a while, remuneration and narrative were about creatives/hackers, but the work and outcomes were conservative and managerial. Software was Taylor Swift-priced but "uncredited studio musician"-outcomed.

* <https://jeremymikkola.com/posts/developer_productivity.html>
* The minimalism is great, the lack of formal structure is worse. Apart from the expected notions, the stress on fluent and fast tools is one I identify with the most. 
> Tooling that reacts quickly. Developers are constantly using tools: their editor highlights code and autocompletes method names, git commits the code, a build system runs tests. Every additional second of time these tools take has a high cost when multiplied by how often they run. Besides the raw cost in minutes and hours, slow tools also break a developer’s focus. Having your work stopped in its tracks by a slow tool is also frustrating, especially to someone who is stressed about timelines.

People are, for various reasons — for multiple reasons — they’re afraid to think really big. There are multiple reasons. One, it seems overreaching. Two, it seems like it would be an awful lot of work. [laughs]As an outside person, I’m like an instructor in some fitness class. I can tell someone who’s already working as hard as they can, “All right, push harder.”[laughter]It doesn’t cost me any effort. Surprisingly often, as in the fitness class, they are capable of pushing harder. A lot of my secret is just being the person who doesn’t have to actually do the work that I’m suggesting they do.COWEN: How much of what you do is reshuffling their networks? There are people with potential. They’re in semi-average networks —GRAHAM: Wait. That was such an interesting question. We should talk about that some more because that really is an interesting question. Imagine how amazing it would be if all the ambitious people can be more ambitious. That really is an interesting question. There’s got to be more to it than just the fact that I don’t have to do the work.COWEN: I think a lot of it is reshuffling networks.

Ayako Wakao is Otsuya, the daughter of a wealthy merchant who gets kidnapped and forced into prostitution. A demented tattoo artist engraves a large, black, human-faced spider on her back that turns her into a murderess, hell-bent on annihilating the men who abused her. A star-studded collaboration adapted from renowned author Jun’ichirō Tanizaki's novel by writer-director Kaneto Shindô (The Naked Island, Onibaba) and photographed by the legendary Kazuo Miyagawa (Rashomon, Ugetsu) in entrancing, sumptuous Eastmancolor, The Spider Tattoo is Masumura’s most visually striking film.

> Have you had someone ask you for a favor that seemed unreasonable — a referral you didn’t want to make, a long-term stay at your place, a sizable cash loan? But because they asked, you felt obliged to seriously consider it, to try to meet their request, even if it put you in a space of discomfort? Maybe you carry out the favor, but it sours your relationship, and when it all comes out, that person says, “Well why’d you agree to it? You could have just said no!”But you feel resentful that that person even put you in a position to have to say, “Sorry we’re a bit busy that week so don’t have space for you to stay with us,” or “I can’t loan you that money at the moment”?Congratulations, you’ve just encountered a clash between ask culture and guess culture.

#### 9.3. Managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) With Terraform
* <https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-infrastructure-as-code>
* A bit of an overkill OR what a wonderful longread? Probably somewhere in the middle. Like the description of ClickOps. Been there, done that...
> ClickOps is the term used to describe the manual management of IT infrastructure from the UI, by clicking into the portal to achieve a desired behavior (create/edit/delete resources). One may argue this process is enough for a small architecture that needs to be deployed, but there actually are some big issues with starting like this: you cannot easily scale and replicate your configuration. Imagine you are creating an EC2 Instance inside AWS. By using ClickOps, you are going to create it way faster than you would normally do it through Infrastructure as Code. But what happens if you need to create 10 EC2 instances? What about 100 EC2 instances? Let’s suppose it takes an engineer approximately two minutes to create an EC2 through the portal. For 100 instances, this will take a little over three hours, and maybe some can be ok with that. These 100 instances will also need to reside in a network, they will require security groups, maybe some EBS storage, and other things that will again take a lot of time to configure. Doing this manually is very error-prone, as our attention span cannot keep up with the large number of things that we have to do. By using Terraform, you can easily define all of these components as code, validate the code, plan to see what is going to happen, and in the end, deploy all resources in one go. Apart from that, you can easily scale and replicate your configuration without spending too much time.

* <https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/jerusalem-demsas/>

> The notion that men do well in societies in relative terms when there’s a lot of war, and it’s better to get rid of war, but when you get rid of war, a lot of men won’t do that well because they’re not well-suited to that kind of society. That’s the alternative reading. That to me is more on the table than arguing about the small, “Do we start the men a year later?” which I’m not opposed to. I don’t know, but maybe we’re just better off shifting into a society where a lot more men do worse and suck it up and take the net gain of less war.

> Knausgaard has been compared to Marcel Proust for the way he moves capaciously through time; the careful, acute attention he pays to the life that lives inside of the mundane. He has a masterful sense of the elasticity and utility of movement within a fictional space. When I asked him about this, he said his three key texts (his answer to almost every question involves another text, a work of art, a film) are Proust, James Joyce’s Ulysses (“though I’m not sure if I like it, really,” he says), and Virginia Woolf’s To The Lighthouse. “That’s why I called the My Struggle books fiction,” he said, “because they deal with time the way only fiction can.”

Stavridis recommends what is essentially basic Stoicism. “You do that,” he writes, “by being reasonably rested; clearing your mind of all the excess white noise (including your personal thoughts); breathing deeply and steadily; lowering your voice, never raising it; and constantly moving your field of view across the sensors and members of the firing team arrayed in front of you.”

> she stays committed to Hitler even as it becomes increasingly evident that Britain is going to be going to war with Germany.So 1939 she goes to be the festival there with Diana.And Hitler basically says to them, look, you should get out of Germany because we are going to be going to war and Diana Julie goes back home, but Unity stays there and maybe one of the reasons why Unity stays there and a very physical evidence, both of Hitler's favor and of her desire to become German is that Hitler has given her a flat.So he had given her a choice of four flats in Munich. She'd gone round. She'd chosen the one that she wanted, went around the house and these curtains won't do at all. We must get rid of this awful sofa. Meanwhile, the two people who are being dispossessed, both of whom are Jewish are sitting in the hallway sobbing and she pays them no attention at all.

In his 1993 book Islam and the West, Lewis wrote "What imperial purpose was served by deciphering the ancient Egyptian language, for example, and then restoring to the Egyptians knowledge of and pride in their forgotten, ancient past?"

#### 10.12. Jacob Mikanowski on Eastern Europe (Ep. 192)
* <https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/jacob-mikanowski/> 
> In Poland, there’s a name for — there are two schools of thought on what Poland is and should be. They come from the two dynasties that ruled Poland, the first two dynasties: there’s Piast Poland and Jagiellonian Poland. Piast is that more narrow, one-culture, one-religion — that’s what’s been assigned to it. That’s the dominant view. The Jagiellonians are this bigger, “We’re a confederation of peoples. We’re a bigger country. We have a big-tent version of Polishness.” I come from that.I think there’s more to it than most Americans know and also, in a way, than some Poles know.COWEN: This polycultural background: How much do you feel it has strong, deep roots? Is it your view that “Well, now it’s mostly gone; it really will not come back”? Or the fact that what we now call Poland was so strongly polycultural, say, 100 years ago, 150 years ago — that this will, in some sense, reemerge, and it will reemerge because it had been part of the past for so long?MIKANOWSKI: Really interesting, because it really was deeply rooted. Deep in the Middle Ages. Definitely in early modernity. And that old, supposedly mostly Polish Poland actually was hard to recover. It was the western part of Poland: it had tons of Germans (which people forget). It was also, in a different way, different balance, multiethnic.The 20th century did so much to change Poland’s geography, Poland’s borders, Poland’s ethnic and religious makeup, that if you had asked me that 15 years ago, 10 years ago, I’d say no. Poland is what it is. Poland is the white eagle, the pope, the Catholic Church. It’s a pretty set thing.It’s amazing how much I think the war in Ukraine has changed things. That we’re going towards — and the influx of Ukrainians, and actually Belarusians too. There are also Chechens in a smaller number; people from the former Soviet Union. Because of that war, the perceptions of difference have really shifted in Poland. From a very closed society, I think it’s opened up a little bit in a very meaningful way. It’s recovering some of that polyethnicity that it had lost. We’ll see how lasting that is, but I think it’s something that has really shifted the last few years.

> Event tracking is a riddle of a technology. It defies attempts to turn it into a feature (more on this later), but unlike ETL, it often isn't treated as its own category. It's an "I work in a café" technology - "oh that's cool, what else do you do?".

#### 10.16. On a Lack of Ambition - by Maxi Gorynski
* <https://heirtothethought.substack.com/p/on-a-lack-of-ambition>
* I love how Tyler Cowen's podcast questions inspire others to think and write and develop the answers. The take on Foucault and, mainly, Augustine, I find, honestly a bit hysterical. Not quite sure he has ever read the classics themselves. 
> We have since at least the middle of the 20th century, prompted by the ideological desolation following World War II, been sliding into historical despair. This has been consolidated in the early 21st century by the increasing popularity of unfalsifiable identitarian doctrines stemming from the work of Foucault and his acolytes. Much of Foucault’s most popular work revolves around suggestions that all social connections are zero-sum power relations, and that ‘truth’ is a purely subjective concept. This has led to a sentimentalisation of history among the most highly-educated and, subsequently, a revulsion towards it. Even where a belief that history is where bad people live does not take hold in the individual, it forms a kind of miasma swirling around the resistant individual which that individual must then expend great energy to fight against — and it is a draining and emotionally taxing fight, for they who know that history is more than something to get upset about also know that all our hopes for the future lay in its archives.

> And it seems that the moment Baghdad is founded, scholars from across the near east are kind of zooming in on Baghdad now, why are they going there essentially because they know that they're going to get sponsorship, which in turn begs the question. Well, why are they sure of that part of it?I think is that we talked about how Al Mansour has this ambition to make Baghdad a universal city in terms of time as well as space that he wants to fold in the learning and achievements of previously non-Islamic civilizations into Baghdad so that they can serve the greater glory of Islam. And that means that he is interested in all ancient civilizations. So not just the Greeks, but the Persian as well.And again, I think if there's been a theme throughout these episodes, it's the importance of Persian culture on the making of Baghdad. So a lot of the first Greek texts to be translated are actually written in Persian and House Of Wisdom, Beit Al Hikma was actually the Persian Sasanian word for a library. So that's, that's what itis.So the House Of Wisdom is probably founded by Al Mansur in Baghdad in, you know, very, very self conscious emulation of the Persian example. That's what he's trying to do. And it exists specifically to house books that have been translated, not from Greek but fromPersian, right? So these are translations of Persian translations of Greek.So the House Of Wisdom is not a center for the translation of writings from Greek. It's not a research center, it's not a kind of conference center where scholars meet up. It is basically a library as the Library OfAlexandria was. But with the establishment of that, you have other Caliphs who come in and they all have their own motives.So Al Madi, the pigeon racer, he's a very devout Muslim. He's very concerned to purify and clarify Muslims understanding of their faith. So he has a lot of debates with the Christian patriarchTimothy who has invited to set up shop in Baghdad. And in the course of these debates, it's evident, I think that Al Madi realizes how much Christian theology has benefited from its immersion in Greek philosophy.So in Plato, but also particularly Aristotle, he's the first Tiff to commission translations of Aristotle directly from Greek. I think he is doing that kind of rather in the spirit that the Chinesetoday might, you know, steal intellectual property from Stanford University or something like that.

> YoungX777 had been discovered by 25/7 in late October 2022, after Luzi and his two full-time music scouts had glimpsed promise in the data for his song “Toxic.” A sludgy sonic wallop about suicidal ideation, the song hadn’t racked up many streams. But its five-second intro, a post-toke cough followed by a throaty scream, had popped up in a few TikToks of MMA fighters pummeling each other and weightlifters grunting beneath squat bars. Experience had taught 25/7 Media that when brief “recreates” of these kinds of songs burble up in those particular TikTok communities, virality can soon follow.When the number of recreates climbs into the tens or hundreds of thousands, Magana told me, two of 25/7’s core tenets become germane. The first: Once a social media user hears an audio snippet nine times, it gets stuck in their head to some degree. The second, which Magana has dubbed the Ten Percent Rule, is that 10 percent of those earwormed users will end up tracking down the snippet’s original source

Adam was a competitive springboard diver growing up, “and I found it enormously helpful to get a 0 to 10 score every time I came out of the water.” When he transitioned from sports to the work world, he found it hard to get useful feedback. “So I started asking people—I would give them drafts—and I’d ask, ‘can you rate this 0 to 10?’” After a presentation—what would you score that 0 to 10? After giving a talk, after leading a meeting, after publishing a newsletter, whatever—ask, can you score this 0 to 10?

#### 11.4. Attenuating Innovation (AI) – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/>
* Apart from the philosophy of innovation which I don't care about as much, there is a wonderful exceptionalism of tech industry as the western cauldron of progress. Looking at the arrival of AI from the perspective of a person intimately involved with both operations and programming, I cannot be more excited. AI is like the arrival of keyboards or monitors or the departure of punchcards, if you will. 
> More broadly, tech sure seems like the only area where innovation and building is happening anywhere in the West. This isn’t to deny that the big tech companies aren’t sometimes bad actors, and that platforms in particular do, at least in theory, need regulation. But given the sclerosis present everywhere but tech it sure seems like it would be prudent to be exceptionally skeptical about the prospect of new regulation; I definitely wouldn’t be celebrating it as if it were some sort of overdue accomplishment.

#### 11.5. Like Any Other? : Annie Ernaux’s A Woman Story
* <https://frenchlitforall.medium.com/like-any-other-annie-ernauxs-a-woman-story-5d5559e6728a>
* Reading Ernaux with my wife as part of her studies. 
> There is something bittersweet about the fact that Annie Ernaux’s most popular book remains A Man’s Place (Fr: La place). On one hand, La place is a brief, austere but still rich account of the life of a man whose life would not be seen as worthy of literary writing. On the other, however, Ernaux has other books that deserve attention for venturing beyond her typical powerful explorations of social class in France, such as La honte (discussing the delicate issue of domestic violence), L’événement (touching on the sensitive experience of the author with abortion) and Une Femme (about her mother’s ordinary life until she developed Alzheimer’s). In Une Femme (A Woman’s Place in the translation by Tanya Leslie), Ernaux insists that even though her mom was a rather ordinary person, she still learned a lot from her. Moreover, it is interesting to see Ernaux try to negotiate her emotions with her knowledge: her mom’s demeanor, often crass and mean, was not just her essence but rather a result of the environment she grew up in. Understanding human beings as a result of sociological phenomena around them, however, does not get rid of painful words exchanged by mother and daughter. In spite of that, Une Femme works as Ernaux’s way to celebrate her mother for what she was: a working-class woman devoted to her family, one somehow like any other and unlike any other in France.

Underestimating his enemies’ capabilities and overestimating his own, he assumed that the woods behind the British would block their retreat, but Wellington had strategically used the forest to hide more soldiers. An overnight downpour had left the fields soggy, and Napoleon, instead of striking at nine, as he had planned, held off until midday, giving the Prussians crucial time to reach Wellington as backup. Napoleon was tired. He was ill. He was strangely apathetic, declining to survey parts of the battlefield himself. Michael Broers, a Napoleon scholar at Oxford, told me, “The real question isn’t so much Why did he lose? but How on earth did he ever think he could win?”

* The final argument for my complete conversion to helix editor.
> The major difference, even before the reversed motion/verb thing, is the fact that Helix doesn’t really have a cursor. It has the concept of selections. A selection is made of two entities:An anchor.A cursor.The cursor is the part of the selection that moves when you extend the selection. The anchor, as the name implies, is the other part that stays where it is: it’s anchored. By default, you have only one selection and the anchor is located at the same place as the cursor. It looks similar to any other editor. Things start to change when you begin typing normal commands. Typing l, for instance, will move both the anchor and cursor to the right, making them a single visual entity. However, if you type w, the cursor will move to the end of the word while the anchor will move to its beginning, visually selecting the word. If you type W, the anchor won’t move and only the cursor will move, extending the selection. If you press B, it will move the cursor back one word, shrinking the selection. You can press <a-;> to flip the anchor and the selection, which is useful when you want to extend on the left or on the right.This concept of selection is really powerful because everything else is based on it.

I suspect we humans do better with constraints; the Internet stripped away the constraint of physical distribution, and now AI is removing the constraint of needing to actually produce content. That this is spoiling the Internet is perhaps the best hope for finding our way back to what is real. Let the virtual world be one of customized content for every individual, with the assumption it is all made-up; some may lose themselves to the algorithm and AI friends, but perhaps more will realize that the only way to survive online is to pay it increasingly little heed.

#### 11.19. Vim’s Big Idea. Learning the lesson of vi
* <https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1>
* An interesting thesis that emacs came with the idea that your editor should be customizable and it should be personalized to your preferences. New editors are platforms for extensions and VSCode exemplifies this trend started by emacs. However the composable nature of commands that was introduced by vi/vim is still only in some editors. I think that multi-modality is for programmers or power users. The learning curve is too steep if the return of investment is not meaningful. For that, you need to write a lot. Mostly code, I would say. I write markdown/thoughts, and yes, some python scripts. The vim is interesting phenomologically. It just is a different and very attractive experience, something that programming gives you - the experience of power. 
> ut now let’s look at delete commands. Let’s say you want to delete a word, delete to the end of the line, delete to the end of the file, or delete to the end of a paragraph.Emacs only has two of these functions: kill-word and kill-line. Atom has the same two, more or less: deleteToEndOfWord() and deleteLine().Vim, though, is different. Vim only has one command: d, which is “delete.” What does it delete? You name it, literally. The d command gets combined together with those commands for movement: dw deletes to the next word, d$ to the end of the line, dG to the end of the file, and d} to the end of the paragraph.This is where Vim’s composability leads to its power. Emacs and Atom don’t have commands for deleting to the end of a file or a paragraph — even when they have commands to move to those places. But in Vim, if you can move to a location, you can delete to that location.

* Someone elses problems to learn from!
> This may sound like a very stupid mistake you will never make (or even can’t make - in bigger companies). It might be true. The problem is not the wrong SQL command. A small human mistake is never the true problem. Me running that command, is just the end of a whole chain of failures.Working on production during the weekend - why? In this case, it was not even that urgent. Nobody asked me to fix it immediately. I could have easily waited for Monday.Who the hell runs something on a prod DB without running it on QA first?Why did I manually edit the DB and not use an API call?And if there was no API - why didn’t I call a teammate and have ‘4-eyes’ on such a sensitive action?And the worst part - why didn’t I use transactions? It’s as easy as writing ‘Begin’, and then using Rollback in case of a mistake.

> These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird, you're living badly.

> Slicing. Take a big project, cut it into thin slices, and rearrange the slices to suit your context. I can always slice projects finer and I can always find new permutations of the slices that meet different needs.
> One thing at a time. We’re so focused on efficiency that we reduce the number of feedback cycles in an attempt to reduce overhead. This leads to difficult debugging situations whose expected cost is greater than the cycle overhead we avoided.

> The theme here is scaling your brain. The journeyman learns to solve bigger problems by solving more problems at once. The master learns to solve even bigger problems than that by solving fewer problems at once. Part of the wisdom is subdividing so that integrating the separate solutions will be a smaller problem than just solving them together.
