#### Ask HN: Programmers who don't use autocomplete/LSP, how do you do it? 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42492508>
Interesting debate on VIM vs IDE. I write Bash in Vim and Python in IDE (VSCode + iPython) and although enamoured by David Baeyzley's mastery, the IDE's just where I'm at with that particular language. To each his own, I think for this.

#### Remembering Mike Maples, Sr.
* <https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/remembering-mike-maples-sr>
All along, Mike created a culture of respect, collaboration, and most of all “promise and deliver”. He instilled in everyone the most basic notion of saying what you’re going to do and doing that well.

#### AI’s Uneven Arrival – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/>
An eye-opener for o3. This is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models. For context, ARC-AGI-1 took 4 years to go from 0% with GPT-3 in 2020 to 5% in 2024 with GPT-4o. All intuition about AI capabilities will need to get updated for o3, which performs at 75% for ths test.

#### The Origins of Wokeness
* <https://paulgraham.com/woke.html>
We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something that we'd previously been able to say, our initial assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent something from being said will usually claim they're not merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm; they have to prove it.

#### Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams - Software Engineering Daily
* <https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams>

#### Principles - Nabeel S. Qureshi
* <https://nabeelqu.substack.com/p/principles?publication_id=107423&utm_campaign=email-post-title&r=3o9&utm_medium=email>
“Aim for Chartres” (Christopher Alexander) — when doing something, aim to be the best there ever was at it. This compensates for your natural bias, which is to do something mediocre. You have to really aim to be as good as the greats.

#### Show HN: GUI for editing Mermaid class diagrams 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42738656>

#### The quiet rebellion of a little life 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42769751>
Near as I can tell there is a not-insignificant part of the American psychological context that amounts to a threat of utter destitution should you not choose to keep slaving away. By Krom, America needs homeless people to show you just how far you can fall unless you keep serving the man.

#### AI Slop, Suspicion, and Writing Back
* <https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/01/25/AI-Slop-Suspicion-and-Writing-Back/>
I do AI slop as well and I own it on my blog.

#### From open source to acquired with Ashley Jeffs (Changelog Interviews #625)
* <https://changelog.com/podcast/625>
On Benthos Stream Processing, from OS to being bought by Red Panda. Very funny at times, the humor there seemed like instilled in Benthos itself.

#### Jinja (template engine) - Wikipedia
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)>
Using Jinja for a simpler task as it was a first thing that occured to me. I should have just used a built-in Template module though. I did not need any programming logic in the template just a simple placeholders.

#### Good Lord - by Benn Stancil - benn.substack
* <https://benn.substack.com/p/good-lord>
Such a brave critique of the politics of current Silicon Valley and catching its own hypocricies. Amazing and inspiring.

#### Antiqua et Nova: Note on the relationship between AI and human intelligence 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42877709>

### Feb-2025
#### Don't Believe Him (by Ezra) 
* <https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-trump-column-read.html>
Perception cannot become reality so easily. Can it?

#### Introducing self-describing JSONs

Learning about semi-structured data, this self-describing JSON approach rhymes with that.

#### 49 Small Truths About Marriage All Couples Understand - Fatherly

#### Turso is rewriting SQLite in Rust with Glauber Costa, CEO at Turso (Changelog Interviews #626)

#### Beej's Guide to Network Programming
* <https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/what-is-a-socket.html#what-is-a-socket>
Socket Programming featured in David Beazley's famous live coding - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4 - so as I am new to network programming, I'm glad to have some intro here to better enjoy the talk, really (not doing any of that myself)

#### Trumpian policy as cultural policy - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/trumpian-policy-as-cultural-policy.html>
Another important take for me - on cultural change there already was one about "The vibes have changed" that came out before the election. This is an implementation of cultural change by "flooding the zone" by filling media with agenda, constant, without time taking for implementation. It's just an aggresive take on the existing discourse. Fascinating.

#### Fallthrough & Friends with Matthew Sanabria & Kris Brandow (Changelog & Friends #77)
* <https://changelog.com/friends/77>
On documentation: what's often missing is I think my biggest gripe right now is just how few docs we have, how little documentation so many things have. But if there was a way… I think there was especially – what was it? There was one that was like the discover and learn steps. I am very frustrated often at libraries that I want to go in and understand, and there’s no “Oh, start looking here.” Or like “Here’s the basic architecture that you can then use to understand how this codebase is laid out, so you can go read the code and understand how we’ve implemented all of these things.” That documentation is almost always completely missing.

#### QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer: Visual tool to explore SQLite databases page-by-page, the way they're stored on disk and the way SQLite sees them.
* <https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer>
SQLite (and most databases) store data in disk-block-sized pages, usually 4KB, which helps make reads and writes as fast as possible.

Normally developers interact with databases on the "schema level" - tables, rows, and SQL. But taking a peek at the "page level" can give you some interesting insights:

#### Continuous reinvention: A brief history of block storage at AWS 
* <https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/08/continuous-reinvention-a-brief-history-of-block-storage-at-aws.html>

#### Marshmallow Test and Parenting - @desunit (Sergey Bogdanov)

#### Firing programmers for AI is a mistake 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43010814>
Another long thread on HN about what AI is going to do to programmers. My thoughts are on Walter Benjamin§s essay on Art and Mechanical Reproduction.
