#### Planning as is a software engineering value destroying mistake
* [Driving engineers to an arbitrary date is a value destroying mistake](https://iism.org/article/driving-engineers-to-an-arbitrary-date-is-a-value-destroying-mistake-49)
>  Programming (one programmer working alone without too much money/time pressure imposed by others) is quiet different from software engineering (multiple programmers, stakeholders, designers, etc., with time and money constraints). Everyone loves programming (and so doing programming usually leads to high-quality and useful products), almost everyone hates software engineering.

### AUG 2021
#### Hammock Driven Development
* [Hammock Driven Development \- Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
* Intruiging praise of contemplation/slowdown applied for software engineering 

### SEP 2021

* [If it will matter after today, stop talking about it in a chat room – Mike Crittenden](https://critter.blog/2021/01/12/if-it-matters-after-today-stop-talking-about-it-in-a-chat-room/)
* ... but I still use _Copy link_ in Slack and paste it to tickets way too often

#### Software should convey a sense of calm
* [Stay Calm and Learn This](https://patrickjuchli.com/en/posts/learning-experience/)
* Too abstract and high-level for my taste, but the opening paragraph got me

#### Dieter Rams' principles of good design applied to software engineering
* [dieter rams 10 applied to software](https://github.com/zedr/dieter-rams-10-applied-to-software)

* Clearly resonating with the brilliant [Reading postmortems](https://danluu.com/postmortem-lessons/)

* [Studying the relationship between exception handling practices and post-release defects](https://neverworkintheory.org/2021/09/16/exception-handling-practices-and-post-release-defects.html))
> The longer the exception handling blocks in a file, the more likely the file is to contain bugs. What's more, the length of the file and the length of its exception handling blocks aren't correlated, so exception handler length really does contain novel information.

### OCT-2021
#### The inflation of the term Best Practices
* [Best Practices (why I Hate Them)](https://fev.al/posts/best-practices/)+
* Thinking properly about the language, somewhere in the Orwellian tradition, but also SICP stress of using appropriate langugages in engineering comes to mind

#### What to Learn 
* [What to learn - Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/learn-what/)
* An intriguing defense of hedgehog mentality in the dualism of [The Hedgehog and the Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)

#### Productivity and Velocity
* [Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity](https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/)
* Dan is making me sharpen my typing skills with this

#### Bash functions are better than I thought
* [Bash functions are better than I thought](https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-10-31-better-bash-functions/)
* More Importantly, the following [HN discussion thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29058140)

### NOV-2021
#### Microsoft and the Metaverse
* [Microsoft and the Metaverse – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/)
* Great example of changing one's mind and an interesting argument of why VR should matter besides psychotherapy (gaming and porn are self-evident sad-stories)

#### python - Relative imports for the umpteenth time - Stack Overflow
* [python - Relative imports for the umpteenth time - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-umpteenth-time/14132912#14132912)
* Actually reading the thread and finding great technical explanations

#### Linus on Linebreaks
* [LKML: Linus Torvalds: Re: clean up kernel_{read,write} & friends v2](https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/29/1038)
* and the accompanying [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29370692) with bullet points from one contributor that sounds like an except from a Letter to a Young Developer — taking this to heart

> My mind is blown on an almost daily basis when some of our junior developers shares their screen with me. Two of them consistently have: 1. horizontal task bar; 2. display scaling set to 125% or worse (1080 native) 3. a terminal launched from VSCode (whaaaaaaaaaat) they leave on the bottom...

### DEC-2021
#### Three Steps to the Future
* [Presentations — Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/presentations)
* More than the content itself, a great example of presentation aesthetics, something I believe Seth Godin recommends in both 
    - [Really Bad Powerpoint, 2007 ](https://seths.blog/2007/01/really_bad_powe/) 
    - [Words on slides, 2018](https://seths.blog/2018/04/words-on-slides/)

#### 0-Day (Computing)
* [Zero-day (computing) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing))
* Related to [Log4Shell: RCE 0-day exploit found in log4j2, a popular Java logging package](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/); experiencing and watching wide security vulnerability incident, something I only heard of up until this point

#### Some Thoughts on Writing
* [Some thoughts on writing - Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/writing-non-advice/)
* As always, a great contrarian journey into the weeds of style of technical blogging. 
* I would agree that _write as I write_ could be a bad advice - however I believe that you do learn by copying (Bach used to re-write whole compositions of other composers); as for writing I believe that finding your authentic voice is (for me) helped by finding texts that feels as if they were _written for me_ (like Dan's blog!); then I intentionally (steal) or unintentionally (mimic) it

#### Culture Matters
* [Culture matters — Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/culture/)
* In other words: 
> But one of the things that Cambridge could do and later Bell Labs could do is somehow raise people’s expectations of themselves. Raise the level that’s considered acceptable. You walk in and you see what people are doing, you see how people are doing it, you see how apparently easily they do it, you see how nice they are while doing it, and you realize, “I better sharpen up my game.” You have to get better because what is acceptable has changed. Some organizations can do that but most can’t to that extent. I’ve just been very, very lucky to be in a couple of places that actually can increase your level of ambition and the level of what is a good standard.
