### JAN 2022
#### Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy
* [Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy - UnHerd](https://unherd.com/2021/12/ernst-junger-our-prophet-of-anarchy/)
* Jünger despised Celine because of the lack of the skin in the game
> A fêted intellectual, and a lifelong francophile, he befriended the city’s cultural elite, socialising with Cocteau and Picasso as well as the collaborationist French leadership and literary figures such as the anti-semitic novelist Céline, a monster who “spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews — astonishment that anyone who had a bayonet was not making unrestrained use of it”. For Jünger, Céline represented the very worst type of radical intellectual: “People with such natures could be recognised earlier, in eras when faith could still be tested. Nowadays they hide under the cloak of ideas.

### Steve Yegge: practicing programming
* [steve yegge - practicing-programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)
* an interesting comparison from brought from the (classical) music, but also reminiscent of the importance of [code katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) but also of the (absence of) historical consciousness. Imagine a crazy old excentric engineer doing something along the lines of Riccardo Muti (he is referring to events > half a century ago and considers them essential)

> Riccardo Muti initially insulted and shouted at his successor Riccardo Chailly, who had given up his own private room to the distinguished guest. After the concert, he called for a microphone to address the audience and was ignored by stage staff. He proceeded to shout half-comprehensible and generally **irrelevant comments about Toscanini’s return to La Scala in 1946**.
