### 0.1. JAN 2023

#### 0.1.1. GitHub Copilot preliminary experience report
* <https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/12/05/github-copilot-preliminary-experience-report/>
* Notes on Experience with Github Pilot, similar to that of mine - it has the potential to surprise you, which is great. 
> I was, frankly, stunned. While I do understand that Copilot doesn't actually understand the code it suggests, Hedgehog is sufficiently esoteric that I didn't expect Copilot to have enough training data to enable it to make a useful contribution in this niche. I was wrong. I've repeatedly seen Copilot make suggestions to my F# and Haskell code. It's not just for C#, JavaScript, or python code.

#### 0.1.2. Free YouTube Transcripts
* <https://ytscribe.com/>
* For cases a transcription's required

#### 0.1.3. imaginAIry/README.md at master · brycedrennan/imaginAIry
* <https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry/blob/master/README.md>
* wow
 

#### 0.1.4. Overconfidence and AI 
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/overconfidence-and-ai/>
* My friend told me "AI is bullshitting a lot" which Seth Godin kindly frames as overconfidence
> Human beings are often more effective when we’re a bit self-effacing. “I think,” “Perhaps,” or “I might be missing something, but…” are fine ways to give our assertions a chance to be considered.

#### 0.1.5. Fighting Distraction With Unit Tests 
* <https://matthewc.dev/musings/unit-tests/>
* A hemmingway-style approach to writing code where you stop at writing the failing unit test as a sort of cliffhanger. 
> n/a

#### 0.1.6. ChatGPT Is Only Going to Get Better, and We Better Get Used to It - Bloomberg
* <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-23/chatgpt-is-only-going-to-get-better-and-we-better-get-used-to-it?utm_content=view&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&sref=htOHjx5Y>
* AI is developing in leaps - mind you.
> I ’ve started dividing the people I know into three camps: those who are not yet aware of LLMs; those who complain about their current LLMs; and those who have some inkling of the startling future before us. The intriguing thing about LLMs is that they do not follow smooth, continuous rules of development. Rather they are like a larva due to sprout into a butterfly. It is only human, if I may use that word, to be anxious about this future. But we should also be ready for it.

#### 0.1.7. Key Metrics for Monitoring AWS Fargate 
* <https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/aws-fargate-metrics/>
* How to Monitor ECS Fargate
> 

#### 0.1.8. Amazon ECS container logs for EC2 and Fargate launch types - AWS Prescriptive Guidance
* <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/implementing-logging-monitoring-cloudwatch/ec2-fargate-logs.html>
* ECS does not have replicas or pods but it talks about tasks
> 

#### 0.1.9. How to Profile Your Code in Python 
* <https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-profile-your-code-in-python-e70c834fad89>
* I am wondering why function that I expect to take shorter is taking longer for leetcode puzzles
> Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

#### 0.1.10. ChatGPT's killer enterprise use case will be managing knowledge, says EY CTO 
* <https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpts-killer-enterprise-use-case-will-be-managing-knowledge-says-ey-cto/>
* Knowledge keeping, managing and providing seems to be a killer feature for Enterprise AI
> 

#### 0.1.11. The coming ubiquity - Seth's Blog
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-coming-ubiquity/>
* On the invisible revolution of making AI everywhere allthetime
> But the real impact of AI isn’t going to be that it regularly and consistently does far better than the best human effort. The impact will be that it is widespread, cheap and always there.

#### 0.1.12. SQL should be your default choice for data engineering pipelines
* <https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_sql/>
* After a wave of noSQL tools, this is what you get in the beginning of 2023
> SQL should be the first option considered for new data engineering work. It’s robust, fast, future-proof and testable. With a bit of care, it’s clear and readable. A new SQL engine - DuckDB - makes SQL competitive with other high performance dataframe libraries, making SQL a good candidate for data of all sizes.

#### 0.1.13. dylanjcastillo/shell-genie: Your wishes are my commands
* <https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/shell-genie>
* Another cool project to get info on AI
> Shell Genie is a command-line tool that lets you interact with the terminal in plain English. You ask the genie what you want to do and it will give you the command you need.

#### 0.1.14. Natural language is the lazy user interface - Austin Z. Henley
* <https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html>
* A slight critique of chatgpt as an interface as it lacking a big advangates of adaptable GUI.
> People are anticipating that large language models are going to revolutionize the world. And maybe they will. But a chat bot won't.

#### 0.1.15. On Email and Horses - Study Hacks - Cal Newport
* <https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2023/01/25/on-email-and-horses/>
* Cal Newport's ideas about smartphones being dangerous for anyone under 15 are shocking
>  An iPhone is clearly a superior device to a Motorola Razr, but does this mean 12-year-olds should be using them?

#### 0.1.16. The inside story of ChatGPT: How OpenAI founder Sam Altman built the world’s hottest technology with billions from Microsoft 
* <https://archive.ph/2023.01.25-131857/https://fortune.com/longform/chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-microsoft/>

#### 0.1.17. Oleksiy Danilov interview: 
* <https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2023/01/oleksiy-danilov-interview-weak-people-germany-russia-ukraine>
* n/a
> The West has an old problem: that is fear. The West has always been afraid of the Soviet Union. It believed the USSR was big and powerful and could solve everything quickly through military means. No conclusions were made even after the USSR invaded Afghanistan in 1979. And they couldn’t do anything there against the uneducated, at that moment, the mujahideen. That is when a conclusion should have been made that the USSR is not that powerful.But those conclusions were not made. And the West kept on being afraid.

#### 0.1.18. Five Days in Class with ChatGPT – The Alperovitch Institute
* <https://alperovitch.sais.jhu.edu/five-days-in-class-with-chatgpt/>
* And I say this as somebody who had been a hardened skeptic of the artificial intelligence hype for many years. Note that I didn’t say likely transform. It will transform higher education. Here’s why. The first use-case is that the machine “filters mundane questions,” as one of our students put it quite eloquently. Meaning: you can ask the dumb questions to the AI, instead of in-class. Yes, there are dumb questions—or at least there are questions where the answer is completely obvious to anybody who knows even just a little bit about, say, malware analysis (or has done their assigned readings).
> n/a

#### 0.1.19. Get/Want/Have To 
* <https://seths.blog/2023/01/get-want-have-to/>
* A poetic approach to a mindset - for a thief of moments for passionate endevours, like reading a book for 5 minutes.
> The magic trick begins with realizing that the get to tasks are priceless want to moments if we choose. And, if we’re careful and plan ahead, we can get to the point where the have to agenda is something we can eagerly look forward to.

#### 0.1.20. Alex Epstein's *Fossil Future* - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/01/alex-epsteins-fossil-future.html>
* Remember Macaes: Most dangerous political movement in the West today is not populism, post fascism, wokeism… It’s a reflexive contrarianism that affirms the opposite of every sensible opinion. Silicon Valley actually played a role in this. Idolatry of disruption but now out of its element.
> My overall view is this: it is a good rebuttal to “the unrealistic ones,” who don’t see the benefits of fossil fuels.  But it does not rebut a properly steelmanned case for a transition away from fossil fuels.I view the steelmanned case as this: we cannot simply keep on producing increasing amounts of carbon emissions for centuries on end.  We thus need some trajectory where — at a pace we can debate — carbon emissions end up declining.  I’ve stressed on MR many times that climate change is not in fact an existential risk, but it could be a civilization-destroying risk if we just keep on boosting carbon emissions without end.  I don’t know a serious scientist who takes issue with that claim.

#### 0.1.21. Yiren Lu on Twitter: I’ve been playing around with GPT for various use cases. Here are some low-hanging ones I haven’t heard people mention
* <https://twitter.com/YirenLu/status/1620171019788120066>
* Continuing the discovery of usecases and cultivating the general awareness for the arrival the beast.
> At my agency, a great deal of operational work involves simply taking information from email conversations and inputting them in structured ways into a spreadsheet or web app. This is quite tedious to do, and is prone to errors/missing data. But ChatGPT is pretty good at this!

#### 0.1.22. javascript - Timestamp of when request was submitted from client - Stack Overflow
* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22996416/timestamp-of-when-request-was-submitted-from-client>
* Wrapping my head around network latencies
> You do realize that you cannot trust the client for anything? And that noone knows when the client's request was initiated except the client? – JonApr 10, 2014 at 18:47

### 0.2. FEB 2023
#### 0.2.1. Weaponizing hyperfocus: Becoming the first DevRel at Tailscale
* <https://tailscale.dev/blog/weaponizing-hyperfocus>
* A case study of the new concept - devrel
> In Spring 2022, I sat down and started to take DevRel seriously at Tailscale. I had heard about the practice in the past, but I had never done it before. I knew that a lot of it was talking about a product to people and finding new and interesting ways to use it, but a lot of that seemed too vague to really have any solid place to start from. It's like walking into an empty room and having no idea where to start decorating.At some level though, it felt right for me in a way that I have difficulty describing. It's the same feeling of it being right that I get from working in software in the first place. It felt like the type of rabbit-hole you could spend an entire career in

#### 0.2.2. Launch HN: Needl (YC S22) – Simple search across all your apps 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34598406>
* Cool project, I've been looking for this for a long time - but simply not enough. I need to search across at least ZD HC and Github Repos.
> To give generated answers to questions, we take the first results on Needl and run them through GPT-3 and use an engineered version of the user’s query to prompt GPT-3 accordingly. It’s similar to what Phind.com (Hello Cognition) and Perplexity.ai do with web search.

#### 0.2.3. Ask HN: Suggestions for working effectively with junior devs? 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34628933>
* Thinking about owns dreams? Beware what you wish for. 
> The devs on my team are smart but mostly naive about getting stuff done in the real world. I'm sure they'll figure it out over time. But in the meantime, my days are quite frustrating because I'm in teaching mode most of the time instead of building stuff.Unfortunately you will either need to change your attitude or change teams. In your position, the expectation is that you are mostly a working through others and acting as a force multiplier of their work....And in general, there are two ways to go. The first is to accept the fact that many senior engineering and most staff engineering gigs are more about this kind of mentorship approach than actually doing work. And basically accept that the prime "getting shit done" years of your career are done and you will mostly be working in this new way now.The second is to change jobs where you are back in the driver seat. As a senior engineer, these positions DO exist even at FAANG (over on my team, I am the most junior with 12 years of experience). However, the more senior you get, the harder it is to find a role like this, especially in big tech - its the rare exception. Startups and consulting gigs probably better align with wanting to be hands on keyboard, but at the price of a paycut.

#### 0.2.4. Responsibility - by Kent Beck
* <https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/responsibility>
* Kent Beck always presses for Skin in the Game
> CEO: I take full responsibility for these layoffs.Iñigo Montoya: You keep using that phrase. I do not think it means what you think it means.

* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34656591>

#### 0.2.6. Google testing ChatGPT-like chatbot 'Apprentice Bard' with employees 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34656591>
* Originally this was ChatGPT Passes Google Coding Interview for Level 3 Engineer with $183K Salary
> underestimate the amount of work needed to make improvements. We've been a year away from full self driving cars for the last six years, and it seems like people are getting more cautious in their timing around that instead of getting more optimistic. Robotic manufacturing- driven by AI- was supposedly going to supplant human labor and speed up manufacturing in all segments from product creation to warehousing, but Amazon warehouses are still full of people and not robots.What I've seen again and again from people in the field is a gross underestimation of the long tail on these problems. They see the rapid results on the easier end and think it will translate to continued process, but the reality is that every order of magnitude improvement takes the same amount of effort or more.On top of that there is a massive amount of subsidies that go into training these models. Companies are throwing millions of dollars into training individual models. The cost here seems to be going up, not down, as these improvements are made.I also think, to be honest, that machine learning researchers tend to simplify problems more than is reasonable. This conversation started with "highly scalable system from scratch, or an ultra-low latency trading system that beats the competition" and turned into "the parsing of and generation of this kind of code"- which is in many ways a much simpler problem than what op proposed. I've seen this in radiology, robotics, and self driving as well.Kind of a tangent, but one of the things I do love about the ML industry is the companies who recognize what I mentioned above and work around it. The companies that are going to do the best, in my extremely bias opinion, are the ones that use AI to augment experts rather than try to replace them. A lot of the coding AI companies are doing this, there are AI driving companies that focus on safety features rather than driver replacement, and a company I used to work for (Rad AI) took that philosophy to Radiology. Keeping experts in the loop means that the long tail isn't as important and you can stop before perfection, while replacing experts altogether is going to have a much higher bar and cost.

#### 0.2.7. One dialogue that is missing from the current GPT conversations is about where these technologies will be primarily implemented.  There are two places GPTs can be used:  Product-level: Implemented within products that companies buy Process-level: Implemented within processes of a company by an analyst – similar to how companies use data analysts today
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/02/where-will-the-impact-of-chatgpt-fall-from-my-email.html>
* An interesting new dimension on ChatGPT Enterprise

#### 0.2.8. Where will the impact of ChatGPT fall? (from my email) - Marginal REVOLUTION
* <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/02/where-will-the-impact-of-chatgpt-fall-from-my-email.html>
* An interesting new dimension on ChatGPT Enterprise
> One dialogue that is missing from the current GPT conversations is about where these technologies will be primarily implemented.There are two places GPTs can be used:Product-level: Implemented within products that companies buyProcess-level: Implemented within processes of a company by an analyst – similar to how companies use data analysts todayIf the future has primarily Product-level GPT, then companies like Microsoft clearly win because they have the products (like Teams) where the tech will be embedded and if you want the productivity gains from GPTs you have to go through them.If the future has more Process-level GPT, companies like Zapier and no-code platforms win, because they will be the tools that companies use to implement their custom prompts. (although maybe a “Microsoft Teams Prompt Marketplace” wins as well)

#### 0.2.9. bash - How to access the metadata of a docker container from a script running inside the container? - Stack Overflow
* <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37439887/how-to-access-the-metadata-of-a-docker-container-from-a-script-running-inside-th>
* How to distinguish between various containers
> You can query unix sockets with new curl - but All that said-- this isn't very secure, and environment variables are probably a better bet.

#### 0.2.10. ossu/computer-science: Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!
* <https://github.com/ossu/computer-science>
* A big temptation
> 

#### 0.2.11. Complete External Attack Surface Management 
* <https://detectify.com/>
* Interesting product for external attack surface detection, testing endpoints with scriptattacks
> 

#### 0.2.12. The Four Horsemen of the Tech Recession – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2023/the-four-horsemen-of-the-tech-recession/>
* Great work on imaginery + AI + a comprehensible model to current wave of layoffs in Tech
> 

#### 0.2.13. Anti-pattern - Wikipedia
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Software_engineering_anti-patterns>
* Great metaphor to learn - a warning sign.
> A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated.The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined.If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.

#### 0.2.14. Guido van Rossum: Python and the Future of Programming 
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I>

#### 0.2.15. MotherDuck: Big Data is Dead
* <https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_424>
* DuckDB is positioning itself for doing analysis on what would previously have been considered “big data” but on your laptop. So, for data scientists who know SQL but prefer R or Python - there are limitations there as both R and Python work in memory (there are workarounds, but they are complicated).
> DuckDB allows you to analyse larger datasets (10-100gb lets say) on your machine with very fast SQL queries - whereas before you would have had to load into your warehouse manually to be able to perform those types of analyses or transformations, adding more boring work for data scientists.DuckDB have also added some really nice improvements to their SQL syntax, making SQL nicer to work with for data scientists who are used to the flexibility R and Python allow them.

#### 0.2.16. From Bing to Sydney – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/>
* Unsure how much this matter, and it may be a fad, but having mainstream debates about sentient AI AND unidentified flying objects within a week is borderline weird.
> Look, this is going to sound crazy. But know this: I would not be talking about Bing Chat for the fourth day in a row if I didn’t really, really, think it was worth it. This sounds hyperbolic, but I feel like I had the most surprising and mind-blowing computer experience of my life today.

#### 0.2.17. Good times create weak men @ tonsky.me

* The biggest a-ha moment of the talk was that if you are working on Y and Y is based on X, that does not imply automatically that you would know X also. Even if the people who build X are still around, knowledge does not spread automatically and, without actual necessity, it will go away with the people who originally possessed it.

* simply a great job here
> nspired by the following exchange on Twitter, in which someone captures and posts a valuable video onto Twitter, but doesn't have the resources to easily transcribe it for the hearing-impaired, I thought it'd be fun to try out Amazon's AWS Transcribe service to help with this problem, and to see if I could do it all from the bash command-line like a Unix dork.

> My wife and I re-read This Is Your Time by Ruby Bridges to both boys, which showcases the incredible bravery of the first black child to integrate an all-white elementary school in New Orleans in 1960. This is not the distant path…Ruby Bridges is the same age as my in-laws. We felt it was best to follow that up with another favorite, Each Kindness, and its lesson of how small acts of kindness (like Ruby’s teacher Mrs. Henry) can change the world. My oldest and I just finished the beautiful illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (a popular seller last month!). We promised him a lego set from each book, so he was excited to go straight into the next one in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

* Learning about Countly as I've had one of their solution architects at home for lunch
> ountly's basic plugins provide typical analytics metrics such as simple statistics and referrers for web and mobile devices, but also some more advanced features like scheduling email-based reports and recording JavaScript and mobile app crashes. However, its enterprise edition brings in a wide range of plugins (made either by Countly or by third-party developers) that provide advanced features such as HTTP performance monitoring, funnels with goals and completion rates, A/B testing, and so on. Overall, Countly's community edition is a reasonably rich offering for companies with mobile apps or that are selling products online, and it provides the option to upgrade to the enterprise version later if more is needed.
