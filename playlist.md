### JAN 2022
#### Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy
* [Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy - UnHerd](https://unherd.com/2021/12/ernst-junger-our-prophet-of-anarchy/)
* Jünger despised Celine because of the lack of the skin in the game
> A fêted intellectual, and a lifelong francophile, he befriended the city’s cultural elite, socialising with Cocteau and Picasso as well as the collaborationist French leadership and literary figures such as the anti-semitic novelist Céline, a monster who “spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews — astonishment that anyone who had a bayonet was not making unrestrained use of it”. For Jünger, Céline represented the very worst type of radical intellectual: “People with such natures could be recognised earlier, in eras when faith could still be tested. Nowadays they hide under the cloak of ideas.

#### Steve Yegge, practicing programming
* [steve yegge - practicing-programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)
* an interesting comparison from brought from the (classical) music, but also reminiscent of the importance of [code katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) but also of the (absence of) historical consciousness. Imagine a crazy old excentric engineer doing something along the lines of Riccardo Muti (he is referring to events > half a century ago and considers them essential)

> Riccardo Muti initially insulted and shouted at his successor Riccardo Chailly, who had given up his own private room to the distinguished guest. After the concert, he called for a microphone to address the audience and was ignored by stage staff. He proceeded to shout half-comprehensible and generally **irrelevant comments about Toscanini’s return to La Scala in 1946**.

#### Ben Thomson, The Relentless Jeff Bezos
* [The Relentless Jeff Bezos – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/)
* Re-reading the second most read Stratechery piece of 2020
* Combining with one of my 2020s favorite piece [Culture matters](https://danluu.com/culture/) confirming that when it comes to culture, the [fish stinks from the head down](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/fish-rot-from-the-head-down.html) not only in negative, but also in positive ways (it is emblematic that relentless.com redirects to amazon.com)

#### Bill Gates Gets the Internet
* [Ch 2 Part 2 - Bill Gates "Gets" The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnmrSvU9_ug)
* From the great [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/), showing high adaptability of Bill Gates / Microsoft at the time

#### On the value of in-house expertise
* [Luu, Dan. The value of in-house expertise](https://danluu.com/in-house/)
* An argument for build in the build VS buy debate, claiming that in large-scale orgs there are highly specialized teams that are not directly related to a "core business", that actually function as profit centers (Twitter's kernel team). Always fun when Dan brings interdisciplinary examples, making his footnotes worth to pay attention to.

#### What America’s largest technology firms are investing in
* [What America’s largest technology firms are investing in - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/01/22/what-americas-largest-technology-firms-are-investing-in)
> When the twin foundations of the computer age, the transistor and Claude Shannon’s theory of information, came out of Bell Labs in the mid-20th century, it was not because the labs’ owner, at&t, was facing lots of scrappy competitors. It was because it wanted to make and own the future. Rob Atkinson, head of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank, argues something similar is true today: the Big Five are “oligopolists which use their market power to win the next big thing.”
* Combine with the foundational [The End of the Beginning – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/)

#### Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot
* [Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot - Artur Piszek](https://piszek.com/2022/01/24/stop-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot/)
* Reminds be of a strategy outlined in [The Education of a Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/495065.The_Education_of_a_Speculator) - for playing squash if I remember correctly, where the winner not the one that makes the kill, but the one that makes the least number of [unforced errors](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unforced_error)

#### The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make
* [The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make](https://www.thezbook.com/the-biggest-mistake-i-see-engineers-make/)
* Common at Support Engineering level as well, complement with the [item 7 of Uncle Bob's Craftman's Oath](https://youtu.be/17vTLSkXTOo?t=2608):

> I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me and that I can cover for them.
