Focus on Licence Changes. I've watched too. Great changelog interview with ELK Stack Author. Great post by Antirez about his return to Redis (https://antirez.com/news/144)

#### Programming as Theory Building (1985) [pdf] 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592543>
Discussions of one of my favorite papers and favorite podcast episodes (Future of Code)
