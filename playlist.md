### 1. JAN-2026

#### Prepare for That Stupid World
* <https://ploum.net/2025-12-19-prepare-for-that-world.html>
> normalising the fact that "even if it is completely stupid, AI will be everywhere, get used to it!"

#### I Program on the Subway 
* <https://www.scd31.com/posts/programming-on-the-subway>
Creative use of time. Like Ryan Holiday's suggestion to be extremely careful about interstinial/do-nothing time.

#### Understanding Query Execution with the Analyzer 
* <https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/developer/understanding-query-execution-with-the-analyzer>
Something I'm learning by heart these days. Combining with https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/the-evolution-of-databases-w-wolfram

#### Your Supabase Is Public
* <https://skilldeliver.com/your-supabase-is-public>

#### Creator of Go Crashes out - YouTube

Prime's contrarian take. +1

#### Legendary Game Dev Jonathan Blow 
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHfdUqLmPNU>
The only reasons why games may ever be interesting again and this is because of rants in The Future of Code podcast.

#### Assorted less(1) tips 
* <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46464120>
Learning less!

#### Be Wary of Digital Deskilling - Cal Newport
* <https://calnewport.com/be-wary-of-digital-deskilling/>
* I keep coming to this concept, it's memorable and somewhat valuable

#### I'm addicted to being useful
* <https://www.seangoedecke.com/addicted-to-being-useful/>

#### How I estimate work as a staff software engineer
* <https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/>
Sean again :) The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. This is entirely backwards. Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.

#### Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes ::
* <https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/>
Bookmarking for later, because we started PG managed service starting 2026. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpBA13nQxAk

#### Bridges - by Kent Beck - Software Design: Tidy First?
* <https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/bridges>
important

#### Opinion

Great analysis!

* <https://somehowmanage.com/2026/01/22/a-step-behind-the-bleeding-edge-monarchs-philosophy-on-ai-in-dev/>
Looking at what a quick smartphone adoption done to the genZ, I'm not adopting AI too quickly. Only where it sharpens the old skills.

#### The future of software engineering is SRE 
* <https://swizec.com/blog/the-future-of-software-engineering-is-sre/?utm_source=changelog-news>
robustness, robustness, robustness
