### JAN 2022
#### Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy
* [Ernst Jünger: our prophet of anarchy - UnHerd](https://unherd.com/2021/12/ernst-junger-our-prophet-of-anarchy/)
* Jünger despised Celine because of the lack of the skin in the game
> A fêted intellectual, and a lifelong francophile, he befriended the city’s cultural elite, socialising with Cocteau and Picasso as well as the collaborationist French leadership and literary figures such as the anti-semitic novelist Céline, a monster who “spoke of his consternation, his astonishment, at the fact that we soldiers were not shooting, hanging, and exterminating the Jews — astonishment that anyone who had a bayonet was not making unrestrained use of it”. For Jünger, Céline represented the very worst type of radical intellectual: “People with such natures could be recognised earlier, in eras when faith could still be tested. Nowadays they hide under the cloak of ideas.

#### Steve Yegge, practicing programming
* [steve yegge - practicing-programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming)
* an interesting comparison from brought from the (classical) music, but also reminiscent of the importance of [code katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) but also of the (absence of) historical consciousness. Imagine a crazy old excentric engineer doing something along the lines of Riccardo Muti (he is referring to events > half a century ago and considers them essential)

> Riccardo Muti initially insulted and shouted at his successor Riccardo Chailly, who had given up his own private room to the distinguished guest. After the concert, he called for a microphone to address the audience and was ignored by stage staff. He proceeded to shout half-comprehensible and generally **irrelevant comments about Toscanini’s return to La Scala in 1946**.

#### Ben Thomson, The Relentless Jeff Bezos
* [The Relentless Jeff Bezos – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/the-relentless-jeff-bezos/)
* Re-reading the second most read Stratechery piece of 2020
* Combining with one of my 2020s favorite piece [Culture matters](https://danluu.com/culture/) confirming that when it comes to culture, the [fish stinks from the head down](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/fish-rot-from-the-head-down.html) not only in negative, but also in positive ways (it is emblematic that relentless.com redirects to amazon.com)

#### Bill Gates Gets the Internet
* [Ch 2 Part 2 - Bill Gates "Gets" The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnmrSvU9_ug)
* From the great [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/), showing high adaptability of Bill Gates / Microsoft at the time

#### On the value of in-house expertise
* [Luu, Dan. The value of in-house expertise](https://danluu.com/in-house/)
* An argument for build in the build VS buy debate, claiming that in large-scale orgs there are highly specialized teams that are not directly related to a "core business", that actually function as profit centers (Twitter's kernel team). Always fun when Dan brings interdisciplinary examples, making his footnotes worth to pay attention to.

#### What America’s largest technology firms are investing in
* [What America’s largest technology firms are investing in - The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/01/22/what-americas-largest-technology-firms-are-investing-in)
> When the twin foundations of the computer age, the transistor and Claude Shannon’s theory of information, came out of Bell Labs in the mid-20th century, it was not because the labs’ owner, at&t, was facing lots of scrappy competitors. It was because it wanted to make and own the future. Rob Atkinson, head of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think-tank, argues something similar is true today: the Big Five are “oligopolists which use their market power to win the next big thing.”
* Combine with the foundational [The End of the Beginning – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/)

#### Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot
* [Get ahead by not shooting yourself in the foot - Artur Piszek](https://piszek.com/2022/01/24/stop-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot/)
* Reminds be of a strategy outlined in [The Education of a Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/495065.The_Education_of_a_Speculator) - for playing squash if I remember correctly, where the winner not the one that makes the kill, but the one that makes the least number of [unforced errors](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unforced_error)

#### The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make
* [The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make](https://www.thezbook.com/the-biggest-mistake-i-see-engineers-make/)
* Common at Support Engineering level as well, complement with the [item 7 of Uncle Bob's Craftman's Oath](https://youtu.be/17vTLSkXTOo?t=2608):

> I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me and that I can cover for them.

### FEB 2022
#### Extreme Programming 20 years later by Kent Beck
* [Extreme Programming 20 years later by Kent Beck - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGuTmOUdFbo)
* One of my favorite talks, the often black humor and an interesting facebook "patriotism" of the 2015 are noteworthy
* Also summarized my blog post [The History Of Extreme Programming, Feb, 2022](https://pavolkutaj.medium.com/the-history-of-extreme-programming-dcf6e234cb54)

#### Digital Advertising in 2022
* [Digital Advertising in 2022](https://stratechery.com/2022/digital-advertising-in-2022/)
* In a dialectical conversation with past self from 6 years ago. Adding Amazon to Google and Facebook masters of digital advertising, making it a triumvirate. Witnessing this conversation from one own's thinking of the past is another reason why longevity matters so much and as Malcolm Gladwell puts is

> longevity, I have come to believe, is the most important and most often underestimated indicator of genius

— [Why Paul Simon? - Meta Bulletin](https://malcolmgladwell.bulletin.com/212667970940416/)

#### Cocktail party ideas
* [Cocktail party ideas - Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/)
* Another contrarian piece. Dan seems to understand the old marketing adage that saying something like _if you want an audience start a fight_:
> To validate someone's great idea see if they understand what subproblems need solution for the problem.

#### Stewart Brand on Starting Things and Staying Curious
* [Stewart Brand on Starting Things and Staying Curious (Ep. 142) - Conversations with Tyler](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/stewart-brand/)
* I found this _really_ intriguing, some weird californian marriage of socialism and capitalism that fuelled the idealism of many computer pioneers ???

> I don’t think people know the extent to which the mob took over (Bay Area in the 1960s). At first pornography — there was some really, really creative pornography coming out of basically hippie artists having a good time and turning the camera on. Then the whole dope culture. “No hope without dope.” Everybody was selling or buying marijuana and these other drugs from each other. Then one of the guys, named Super Spade — his arms and legs cut off, and his torso was hung out by Ocean Beach from a tree. And this knowledge of, well, those amateur days of drug sales are gone now, and the big-time players are here in town, and “Do not f — with us.” That was the end of that. Everybody who had been selling dope and learned a little bit of business from doing it, then went into business — legitimate business — and they were good at it.

#### Nobody Cared About My Spreadsheets
* Excel has been my passion and obsession and I consider the Excel bashing to be uninformed / opportunistic
* ...but always a great food for thought, here is a recent thread with Bryan Caplan's compaining that nobody looked into his _spreadsheets_ that served as an evidence for his _Case against Education_
* [No one cared about Bryan's spreadsheets - Marginal REVOLUTION](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/no-one-cared-about-bryans-spreadsheets.html)

* [On Bryan Caplan's spreadsheets](https://www.natemeyvis.com/writing/on-bryan-caplans-spreadsheets/)
* I consider to be the final verdict this
> If the initial data set is small, and you don't know that much about what kind of data you're storing, use a highly flexible, easy-to-modify format to store it (Excel). When the data set gets bigger and/or your knowledge about the data starts to crystalize, then migrate it (Database).

#### Sebastian Mallaby on Venture Capital
* [Sebastian Mallaby on Venture Capital](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sebastian-mallaby/)
* As a software/tech history fan I did enjoy the following association of Yahoo and Apple which I was not aware of previously

> The first example of this is Yahoo, where Jerry Yang and David Filo were in their port-a-cabin on the Stanford campus. They thought they were building a hobby-type thing, and they were proud of Yahoo as a directory of the emerging internet. But Moritz showed up, listened, understood, and said, “This is the new Apple. You are going to make something with a quirky name. Apple was quirky, Yahoo is quirky. You’re going to have a brand, and you’re going to be the face of a new phase in tech history.” He enlarged their sense of themselves.

* On Yahoo and early search engines, see the Chapter 4 of [Internet History Podcast](https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/podcasts-by-chapter/); also noting their rootedness in academia (internet before browsers was largely academic/unix-based and search algorithm is a major academic research problem in computer science)
* Apart from interesting info about VC I fount it interesting how he plans his career in 5-year stints (5-year research dives into a topic followed by a book on the subject)

* By necessity, I am wrapping my head around how to log well and the following section just stuck

> Let me come right out and say it — I do not believe in debuggers. I don’t really know how to use any debugger, and have never used one seriously. Furthermore, I believe that the big fault in debuggers is their basic nature — most failures I debug happened a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. This means that I do believe, with religious fervor, in logging. Logging is the lifeblood of any decent fire-and-forget server system.

* [Essential Life-Learnings from 14 Years of Brain Pickings – The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/10/21/14-years-of-brain-pickings/)
* Not-tech, but it is increasingly difficult in March-2022 to keep calm and carry on without thinking about how to help Ukrainians and what one's values are. So, this comes extremely timely to my personal attention

> Choose joy. Choose it like a child chooses the shoe to put on the right foot, the crayon to paint a sky. Choose it at first consciously, effortfully, pressing against the weight of a world heavy with reasons for sorrow, restless with need for action. Feel the sorrow, take the action, but keep pressing the weight of joy against it all, until it becomes mindless, automated, like gravity pulling the stream down its course; until it becomes an inner law of nature.

* It came as a surprise that he recommends a minimal and clear style for writing scientific papers

> Decide on your paper’s theme and two or three points you want every reader to remember. This theme and these points form the single thread that runs through your piece.

* Not only, but importantly on hubris within the Russian culture

> Russia is a remarkable civilization: in the arts, music, literature, dance, film. In every sphere, it’s a profound, remarkable place—a whole civilization, more than just a country. At the same time, Russia feels that it has a “special place” in the world, a special mission. It’s Eastern Orthodox, not Western. And it wants to stand out as a great power. Its problem has always been not this sense of self or identity but the fact that its capabilities have never matched its aspirations. It’s always in a struggle to live up to these aspirations, but it can’t, because the West has always been more powerful.

* I am somewhat missing the humiliation part as outlined by Masha Gessein in [Ezra Klein Interviews Masha Gessen - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-masha-gessen.html)

* [Transcript: Ezra Klein Interviews Timothy Snyder - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-timothy-snyder.html)

> Ancient Greece got grain from Ukraine. In the 16th century, Poland effectively colonized Ukraine during the Age of Discovery and sold grain from Ukraine around the world for gold and silver that came from Latin America. In the 20th century, Stalin also colonized Ukraine. And he actually used that language...Hitler is looking at Ukraine as a breadbasket. Hitler is looking at Ukraine as the last best opportunity for the Germans to create a colonial system, which he sees as like that of other countries, but coming in later, coming in harder and allowing Germany to catch up and become a superpower, like the British are, like the Americans are from his point of view...So it’s all about Ukraine. The Second World War, in Europe at least, is all about Ukraine. If not for Ukraine, if not for that vision, which we under the heading of “Lebensraum,” there wouldn’t have been a war.

* My colleague Archit summarized 3 major technological breakthroughts of the early 21st century which enabled the universal use of business inteligence methodologies freed from the older constraints (large investment and huge compute demands)
    - 2006 Apache Hadoop (distrubuted big data framework enabling horizontal scaling)
    - 2006 AWS (cloud, no comment)
    - 2012 Redshift (data warehouse in-the-cloud)
* Can be combined with [Storm in the stratosphere: how the cloud will be reshuffled · Erik Bernhardsson](https://erikbern.com/2021/11/30/storm-in-the-stratosphere-how-the-cloud-will-be-reshuffled.html) which claims memorably

> Redshift is a data warehouse (aka OLAP database) offered by AWS. Before Redshift, it was the dark ages. The main player was Teradata, which had an on-prem offering. Startups said no to SQL and used Hadoop—SQL was kind of lame back then, for reasons that in hindsight appear absurd. I'm very happy we're out of this era. Anyway, one vendor was a company called ParAccel. AWS licensed their technology, rebranded it Redshift, and launched in 2012. Redshift at the time was the first data warehouse running in the cloud. It was a brilliant move by AWS, because it immediately lowered the bar for a small company to start doing analytics. You didn't have to set up any infrastructure yourself, or write custom mapreduce and reload the jobtracker all day. You could spin up a Redshift cluster in AWS, feed it humongous amounts of data, and it would … sort of just work.

### APR 2022
#### How Microsoft hired Jim Allchin and destroyed Banyan VINES and created LAN for Enterprise
* [The History of Computing: Banyan Vines and the Emerging Local Area Network](https://thehistoryofcomputing.net/banyan-vines-and-the-emerging-local-area-network)
* One of my favorites, Charles Edge is a young master

> Yet, with incumbents like Banyan VINES and Novel Netware, this is another one of those times when Microsoft saw an opening for something better and just willed it into existence. And the story is similar to that of dozens of other companies including Novell, Lotus, VisiCalc, Netscape, Digital Research, and the list goes on and on and on. This kept happening because of a number of reasons. The field of computing had been comprised of former academics, many of whom weren’t aggressive in business. Microsoft ended up owning the operating system and so had selling power when it came to cornering adjacent markets because they could provide the cleanest possible user experience. People seemed to underestimate Microsoft until it was too late. Inertia. Oh, and Microsoft could outspend on top talent and offer them the biggest impact for their work. Whatever the motivators, Microsoft won in nearly every nook and cranny in the IT field that they pursued for decades. The damaging part for Banyan was when they teamed up with IBM to ship LAN Manager, which ultimately shipped under the name of each company. Microsoft ended up recruiting Jim Allchin away and with network interface cards falling below $1,000 it became clear that the local area network was really just in its infancy. He inherited LAN Manager and then NT from Dave Cutler and the next thing we knew, Windows NT Server was born, complete with file services, print services, and a domain, which wasn’t a fully qualified domain name until the release of Active Directory. Microsoft added Windsock in 1993 and released their own protocols. They supported protocols like IPX/SPX and DECnet but slowly moved customers to their own protocols.

* An intriguing analysis of a _meme_ pinpointing the absolutist tendencies of the internet ruled by a few major centers (Facebook, Google and Amazon)

> sure, the Internet makes possible a wide range of viewpoints — you can absolutely find critics of Black Lives Matter, COVID policies, or pro-Ukraine policies — but the Internet, thanks to its lack of friction and instant feedback loops, also makes nearly every position but the dominant one untenable. If everyone believes one thing, the costs of believing something else increase dramatically, making the consensus opinion the only viable option; this is the same dynamic in which publishers become dependent on Google or Facebook, or retailers on Amazon, just because that is where money can be made.

> Messy code is all alike, every beautiful peace of code is beautiful in its own way.
* In his own words
> It's easier to recognize ugly than to recognize beauty in code and for the reason is that sometimes beauty comes from something that's innovative and unusual and you  have to sometimes think reasonably hard to appreciate that. On the other hand, the messes have things in common and you can have static checkers, dynamic checkers that  find large number of the most common  mistakes and you can catch a lot of sloppiness mechanically.

In all, IBM spent 5 billion dollars in mid-1960s money, which would be $41B today with a cumulative 726.3% rate of inflation. To put things in context around the impact of the mainframe business, IBM revenues were at $3.23 B in 1964 and more than doubled to $7.19 B by 1970 when the next edition, the 370, was released. To further that context, the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the first atomic bomb, cost $2 B. IBM did not have a project this large before the introduction of the S360 and has not had one in the more than 50 years since then. bookmark -url $url -title $title

#### Visual Studio Code is designed to fracture
* <https://ghuntley.com/fracture/>
* Stratechery-like insights into what Microsoft has been up to in the last 10 years, i.e. transitioning itself into a 'service company'
> Circa 9 years ago Microsoft started an internal transformation in the way they delivered software to customers. Instead of directly (ie. in-house) employing quality assurance teams who were dedicated to testing software builds Microsoft's switched to a model based on sprint-based development work and rolling releases with feedback from telemetry data that is gathered from Insider Builds of Microsoft's software. At the same time, wider organisational changes took place in the form of functional restructures, which transitioned Microsoft into becoming a services company. Their Azure cloud-computing offering during this period has grown into a legitimate challenger to Amazon's cloud-computing offering called AWS. The biggest side effect of this change for consumers was that instead of delivering installable products that could be run on-premises Microsoft in true Microsoft form of moving ever so slowly and doing it over a generation of people as not to spook them.

* <https://thehistoryofcomputing.net/the-evolution-of-unix-mac-and-chrome-os-shells>
* Learnt that the variety of shells is possible due to the fact that it is decoupled from the OS
> Brian Fox then added on to the Bourne shell with bash. He was working with the Free Software Foundation with Richard Stallman, and they wanted a shell that could do more advanced scripting but whose source code was open source. They started the project in 1988 and shipped bash in 1989. Bash then went on to become the most widely used and distributed shell in the arsenal of the Unix programmer. Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell and so was backwards compatible with bourne shell but also added features from tcsh, korn, and C shell, staying mostly backwards compatible with other shells. Due to the licensing, bash became the de facto standard (and often default shell) for GNU/Linux distributions and serves as the standard interactive shell for users, located at /bin/bash location. Now we had command history, tabbed auto-completion, command-line editing, multiple paths, multiple options for interpreters, a directory stack, full environment variables, and the modern command line environment.

#### The Services iPhone – Stratechery by Ben Thompson
* <https://stratechery.com/2022/the-services-iphone/>
* Apple treats itself like a fancy club with quite high entry and quite high margins on services that it provides. Since it all works out of the box, my impression is that it makes mostly kids uninterested at ways how computers actually functions. Something I was stuck with when the first 386DX/40 arrived and someone showed me how to start Goblins from command line or even installed Norton Commander. 
> The most surprising announcement of all, though, were the prices. Everything stayed the same! This was not what I, or close followers of Apple like John Gruber, expected at all. After all, Apple’s strategy the past several years seemed to be focused on wringing more revenue out of existing customers. More importantly, the last year has seen a big increase in inflation - What this means is that in real terms Apple’s products actually got cheaper.

#### Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, September 8 
* <https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-8>
* The notion of "information space control" and the "establishment of desired narrative" keeps popping up in ISW daily updates on the situation in Ukraine. There must be an initiative purpose and truthfulness of the narratives permeating the confrontations of problems in general. 
> The Russian MoD repeated its Bilohorivka information mistake by failing to acknowledge the situation around Kharkiv Oblast and establish a desired narrative, leaving milbloggers to fill this gap with criticism of Russian forces. The Russian MoD only claimed to have destroyed a Ukrainian ammunition depot in Balakliya.[7] Some milbloggers complained that the Russian MoD did not seize the information space in a timely manner to prevent the spread of Ukrainian social media on Russian Telegram channels, leading to distrust among Russian audiences.[8] Milbloggers largely supported the Russian MoD’s narratives that the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast had completely failed just days prior to Ukrainian breakthroughs in Kharkiv Oblast.[9] Such a shift in milblogger perceptions of Russian progress in Ukraine can be partially attributed to the flaws in the Russian war-time information strategy...

#### Organizations need to deliberately create data
* <https://datacreation.substack.com/p/organizations-need-to-deliberately>
* In 2017, Economist published [The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data | The Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). Yali (my boss/co-founder) takes an issue of the core metaphor driving not only the value of Big Data, but also the names of the tools (data pipelines, mining, extraction, exhaust). In my reading, he is saying "Data is Software, too", in other words, he repeats the old functional programming insight that the difference between code and data is more complicated than meets the eye (that code == data and data == code?)
> These assumptions are fundamentally wrong. Organizations can deliberately create the data that data scientists and other data consumers need, data that today those organizations simply do not have. More than that, organizations should deliberately create the data that they need: as Peter Norvig observed many years ago - “more data beats clever algorithms, and better data beats more data”: so it makes sense to spend at least as much time creating better data as developing better algorithms.

#### Artificial Intelligence Will Be a Great Equalizer - Bloomberg
* <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-09/artificial-intelligence-will-be-a-great-equalizer>
* 2022 is the year of AI and mainly via progress in image generation - a few places offer this much excitement for me. 
> The people who least need AI are the super-rich. They already can hire armies of servants to manage their obligations, schedules, and so on. They do not need to economize on the use of human labor. The rest of us do, whether directly or indirectly through the businesses we patronize...On average, better educated individuals are more skilled at retraining. So increasing the importance of retraining will have some significant inegalitarian effects, namely that the lesser educated may fall behind or be re-employed at lower wages. This is the real worry about AI, which is not the same as “the robots taking all our jobs.”

#### The History of Computing: The History Of Android
* <https://thehistoryofcomputing.net/the-history-of-android>
* On the beginnings of Android and the smartphone revolution kicked off in 2007/8 with the release of the first iPhone.
> The first iPhone was released in 2007. I think we sometimes think that along came the iPhone and Blackberries started to disappear. It took years. But the fall was fast. While the iPhone was also impactful, the Android-based devices were probably more-so. That release of the iPhone kicked Andy Rubin in the keister and he pivoted over from the Blackberry-styled keyboard to a touch screen, which changed… everything. Suddenly this weird innovation wasn’t yet another frivolous expensive Apple extravagance. The logo helped grow the popularity as well, I think. Internally at Google Dan Morrill started creating what were known as Dandroids. But the bugdroid as it’s known was designed by Irina Blok on the Android launch team. It was eventually licensed under Creative Commons, which resulted in lots of different variations of the logo; a sharp contrast to the control Apple puts around the usage of their own logo. The first version of the shipping Android code came along in 2008.

#### The Paris Review - What Writers and Editors Do - The Paris Review
* <https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/01/05/what-writers-and-editors-do/>
* Another Classic I am returning to Regularly
> writing is about getting to the core, something that can be done only once, in that one way, which can never be repeated, because if you repeat it then you are no longer at the core but at something false that merely resembles. So what writing is about, more than anything else, is not practicing, but failing. Failing, not succeeding, not being able to make it work, failing, failing, failing—but not in order to get to the core at some future time, that would be half-hearted, and the half-hearted is the antithesis of writing, no, failing must come from risking everything, in all earnestness, with the utmost of effort. Failing to get the ball properly under control on the football pitch can be annoying, but it doesn’t hurt. Failing in literature hurts, if it doesn’t then it’s an exercise and can lead nowhere. In other words, in order to write you must trick yourself, you must believe that this time I’m onto something, no matter how worthless it might turn out to be.

Interpretation and compilation are traits of the, well, interpreter or compiler (duh!), i.e. the implementation, not the language. Every language can be implemented with an interpreter and every language can be implemented with a compiler. In fact, many languages have both interpreted and compiled implementations. For example, Haskell has several compiled implementations (Ghc, Jhc, Yhc, Lhv) and an interpreted implementation (Hugs). ECMAScript has pure compiled implementations (V8), and hybrid mixed-mode implementations (e.g. SpiderMonkey AOT-compiles ECMAScript to SpiderMonkey bytecode, then both compiles and interprets this bytecode)

*  In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained —on the contrary!— by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I sometimes have called "the separation of concerns", which, even if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focussing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded simultaneously.

> I think that some of the problem, though, is not so much in the intellectual weaknesses of a lot of conventional postgrad education, but simply almost the crime against humanity of having whole generations of smart people spend the first 30, 35 years of their lives in a total bubble, where they’re in this academic setting, and the rule . . . They become socialized into the academy, just as much as prisoners get socialized into the routines of a prison.

* Yes another argument on less is more in a long term when it comes to productivity and another rebuttal of 'loving 80 hour work weeks' as popularized by young Steve Jobs in Apple. 
> (The same says Mark Andreesen on his partner Horowitz in Tyler Cowen's podcast) “When I was at work, I worked.  And when I was with my family, I concentrated on them. The change in focus cleared and refreshed my mind so that when I went to work, I was efficient…Five to eight hours per day of clear thinking and concentrated work five days per week produces more impressive results than the coffee, chit-chat, and various displacement activities that often fill the time of many of those who think they are working seventy or eighty hours a week.”

>  As Prof. K. Anders Ericsson puts it, "In most domains it's remarkable how much time even the most talented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of performance. The 10,000 hour number just gives you a sense that we're talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people would argue are the most innately talented individuals still need to get to the highest level."

> A note on “the wisdom of production”: by this phrase, we mean the wisdom you get from something running in production—the messy details of how it actually behaves, and how software should actually be designed, rather than a whiteboarded view of a service isolated from the facts on the ground. All of the pages you get, the tickets the team gets, and so on, are a direct connection with reality that should inform better system design and behavior.
